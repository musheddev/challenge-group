### Didache (Week 1)

Introduction:
Source "The Apostolic Fathers" by Michael W. Holmes

The Didache also no as "The Teaching of the Apostles" or "The Teaching" is ponentially one of the earlist christain writings often refenerced by other early chirstian writers, and may have predated most of the new testament. However, sources are few for this document. It is belived to be an oral cliff notes version of what the apostles tought going from church to church in the extended judean region.

Questions:
1. There is evidence of some parts added centries later, can you idenitfy one of suspect verses?
2. According to the didache, what does it mean to be a chirstian?
