### Introductory Note to the Epistles of Ignatius


[a.d. 30–107.] The seductive myth which represents this Father as the little child whom
the Lord placed in the midst of his apostles (St. Matt. xviii. 2) indicates at least the period
when he may be supposed to have been born. That he and Polycarp were fellow-disciples
under St. John, is a tradition by no means inconsistent with anything in the Epistles of either.
His subsequent history is sufficiently indicated in the Epistles which follow.
Had not the plan of this series been so exclusively that of a mere revised reprint, the
writings of Ignatius themselves would have made me diffident as to the undertaking. It
seems impossible for any one to write upon the subject of these precious remains, without
provoking controversy. This publication is designed as an Eirenicon, and hence “few words
are best,” from one who might be supposed incapable of an unbiased opinion on most of
the points which have been raised in connection with these Epistles. I must content myself
therefore, by referring the studious reader to the originals as edited by Bishop Jacobson,
with a Latin version and copious annotations. That revered and learned divine honoured
me with his friendship; and his precious edition has been my frequent study, with theological
students, almost ever since it appeared in 1840. It is by no means superannuated by the
vigorous Ignatian literature which has since sprung up, and to which reference will he made
elsewhere. But I am content to leave the whole matter, without comment, to the minds of
Christians of whatever school and to their independent conclusions. It is a great thing to
present them in a single volume with the shorter and longer Epistles duly compared, and
with the Curetonian version besides. One luxury only I may claim, to relieve the drudging
task-work of a mere reviser. Surely I may point out some of the proverbial wisdom of this
great disciple, which has often stirred my soul, as with the trumpet heard by St. John in
Patmos. In him, indeed, the lions encountered a lion, one truly begotten of “the Lion of the
tribe of Judah.” Take, then, as a specimen, these thrilling injunctions from his letter to
Polycarp, to whom he bequeathed his own spirit, and in whom he well knew the Church
would recognize a sort of survival of St. John himself. If the reader has any true perception
of the rhythm and force of the Greek language, let him learn by heart the originals of the
following aphorisms:—


1 Find time to pray without ceasing.


2 Every wound is not healed with the same remedy.


3 The times demand thee, as pilots the haven.


4 The crown is immortality.^1


1 Does not this seem a pointed allusion to Rev. ii. 10?

10 A Christian is not his own master, but waits upon God.

Ignatius so delighted in his name Theophorus (sufficiently expounded in his own words
to Trajan or his official representative), that it is worth noting how deeply the early Christians
felt and believed in (2 Cor. vi. 16) the indwelling Spirit.
Ignatius has been censured for his language to the Romans, in which he seems to crave
martyrdom. But he was already condemned, in law a dead man, and felt himself at liberty
to glory in his tribulations. Is it more than modern Christians often too lightly sing? —


“Let cares like a wild deluge come,
And storms of sorrow fall,” etc.

So the holy martyr adds, “Only let me attain unto Jesus Christ.”
The Epistle to the Romans is utterly inconsistent with any conception on his part, that
Rome was the see and residence of a bishop holding any other than fraternal relations with
himself. It is very noteworthy that it is devoid of expressions, elsewhere made emphatic,^3
which would have been much insisted upon had they been found herein. Think what use
would have been made of it, had the words which he addresses to the Smyrnæans (chap.
viii.) to strengthen their fidelity to Polycarp, been found in this letter to the Romans, especially
as in this letter we first find the use of the phrase “Catholic Church” in patristic writings.
He defines it as to be found “where Jesus Christ is,” words which certainly do not limit it to
communion with a professed successor of St. Peter.
The following is the original Introductory Notice:—
The epistles ascribed to Ignatius have given rise to more controversy than any other
documents connected with the primitive Church. As is evident to every reader on the very
first glance at these writings, they contain numerous statements which bear on points of
ecclesiastical order that have long divided the Christian world; and a strong temptation has

Christ the High Priest (Philadelphians, cap. 9).


Introductory Note to the Epistles of Ignatius


thus been felt to allow some amount of prepossession to enter into the discussion of their
authenticity or spuriousness. At the same time, this question has furnished a noble field for
the display of learning and acuteness, and has, in the various forms under which it has been
debated, given rise to not a few works of the very highest ability and scholarship. We shall
present such an outline of the controversy as may enable the reader to understand its position
at the present day.
There are, in all, fifteen Epistles which bear the name of Ignatius. These are the following:
One to the Virgin Mary, two to the Apostle John, one to Mary of Cassobelæ, one to the
Tarsians, one to the Antiochians, one to Hero, a deacon of Antioch, one to the Philippians;
one to the Ephesians, one to the Magnesians, one to the Trallians, one to the Romans, one
to the Philadelphians, one to the Smyrnæans, and one to Polycarp. The first three exist only
in Latin: all the rest are extant also in Greek.
It is now the universal opinion of critics, that the first eight of these professedly Ignatian
letters are spurious. They bear in themselves indubitable proofs of being the production of
a later age than that in which Ignatius lived. Neither Eusebius nor Jerome makes the least
reference to them; and they are now by common consent set aside as forgeries, which were
at various dates, and to serve special purposes, put forth under the name of the celebrated
Bishop of Antioch.
But after the question has been thus simplified, it still remains sufficiently complex. Of
the seven Epistles which are acknowledged by Eusebius (Hist. Eccl., iii. 36), we possess two
Greek recensions, a shorter and a longer. It is plain that one or other of these exhibits a


47

corrupt text, and scholars have for the most part agreed to accept the shorter form as rep-
resenting the genuine letters of Ignatius. This was the opinion generally acquiesced in, from
the time when critical editions of these Epistles began to be issued, down to our own day.
Criticism, indeed, fluctuated a good deal as to which Epistles should be accepted and which
rejected. Archp. Usher (1644), Isaac Vossius (1646), J. B. Cotelerius (1672), Dr. T. Smith
(I709), and others, edited the writings ascribed to Ignatius in forms differing very considerably
as to the order in which they were arranged, and the degree of authority assigned them,
until at length, from about the beginning of the eighteenth century, the seven Greek Epistles,
of which a translation is here given, came to be generally accepted in their shorterform as
the genuine writings of Ignatius.
Before this date, however, there had not been wanting some who refused to acknowledge
the authenticity of these Epistles in either of the recensions in which they were then known
to exist. By far the most learned and elaborate work maintaining this position was that of
Daillé (or Dallæus), published in 1666. This drew forth in reply the celebrated Vindiciæof
Bishop Pearson, which appeared in 1672. It was generally supposed that this latter work
had established on an immoveable foundation the genuineness of the shorter form of the
Ignatian Epistles; and, as we have stated above, this was the conclusion almost universally


Introductory Note to the Epistles of Ignatius


accepted down to our own day. The only considerable exception to this concurrence was
presented by Whiston, who laboured to maintain in his Primitive Christianity Revived(1711)
the superior claims of the longer recension of the Epistles, apparently influenced in doing
so by the support which he thought they furnished to the kind of Arianism which he had
adopted.
But although the shorter form of the Ignatian letters had been generally accepted in
preference to the longer, there was still a pretty prevalent opinion among scholars, that even
it could not be regarded as absolutely free from interpolations, or as of undoubted authen-
ticity. Thus said Lardner, in his Credibility of the Gospel History(1743): “have carefully
compared the two editions, and am very well satisfied, upon that comparison, that the larger
are an interpolation of the smaller, and not the smaller an epitome or abridgment of the
larger. ... But whether the smaller themselves are the genuine writings of Ignatius, Bishop
of Antioch, is a question that has been much disputed, and has employed the pens of the
ablest critics. And whatever positiveness some may have shown on either side, I must own
I have found it a very difficult question.”
This expression of uncertainty was repeated in substance by Jortin (1751), Mosheim
(1755), Griesbach (1768), Rosenmüller (1795), Neander (1826), and many others; some
going so far as to deny that we have any authentic remains of Ignatius at all, while others,
though admitting the seven shorter letters as being probably his, yet strongly suspected that
they were not free from interpolation. Upon the whole, however, the shorter recension was,
until recently, accepted without much opposition, and chiefly in dependence on the work
of Bishop Pearson above mentioned, as exhibiting the genuine form of the Epistles of Ignatius.
But a totally different aspect was given to the question by the discovery of a Syriac version
of three of these Epistles among the mss. procured from the monastery of St. Mary Deipara,
in the desert of Nitria, in Egypt. In the years 1838, 1839, and again in 1842, Archdeacon
Tattam visited that monastery, and succeeded in obtaining for the English Government a


48

vast number of ancient Syriac manuscripts. On these being deposited in the British Museum,
the late Dr. Cureton, who then had charge of the Syriac department, discovered among
them, first, the Epistle to Polycarp, and then again, the same Epistle, with those to the Eph-
esians and to the Romans, in two other volumes of manuscripts.
As the result of this discovery, Cureton published in 1845 a work, entitled, The Ancient
Syriac Version of the Epistles of St. Ignatius to Polycarp, the Ephesian, and the Romans, etc.,
in which he argued that these Epistles represented more accurately than any formerly pub-
lished what Ignatius had actually written. This, of course, opened up the controversy afresh.
While some accepted the views of Cureton, others very strenuously opposed them. Among
the former was the late Chev. Bunsen; among the latter, an anonymous writer in the English
Review, and Dr. Hefele, in his third edition of the Apostolic Fathers. In reply to those who
had controverted his arguments, Cureton published his Vindiciæ Ignatianæin 1846, and


Introductory Note to the Epistles of Ignatius


his Corpus Ignatianumin 1849. He begins his introduction to the last-named work with the
following sentences: “Exactly three centuries and a half intervened between the time when
three Epistles in Latin, attributed to St. Ignatius, first issued from the press, and the public-
ation in 1845 of three letters in Syriac bearing the name of the same apostolic writer. Very
few years passed before the former were almost universally regarded as false and spurious;
and it seems not improbable that scarcely a longer period will elapse before the latter be al-
most as generally acknowledged and received as the only true and genuine letters of the
venerable Bishop of Antioch that have either come down to our times, or were ever known
in the earliest ages of the Christian Church.”
Had the somewhat sanguine hope thus expressed been realized, it would have been
unnecessary for us to present to the English reader more than a translation of these three
Syriac Epistles. But the Ignatian controversy is not yet settled. There are still those who hold
that the balance of argument is in favour of the shorter Greek, as against these Syriac Epistles.
They regard the latter as an epitome of the former, and think the harshness which, according
to them, exists in the sequence of thoughts and sentences, clearly shows that this is the case.
We have therefore given all the forms of the Ignatian letters which have the least claim on
our attention.^4 The reader may judge, by comparison for himself, which of these is to be
accepted as genuine, supposing him disposed to admit the claims of any one of them. We
content ourselves with laying the materials for judgment before him, and with referring to
the above-named works in which we find the whole subject discussed. As to the personal
history of Ignatius, almost nothing is known. The principal source of information regarding
him is found in the account of his martyrdom, to which the reader is referred. Polycarp al-
ludes to him in his Epistle to the Philippians (chap. ix.), and also to his letters (chap. xiii.).
Irenæus quotes a passage from his Epistle to the Romans (Adv. Hær., v. 28; Epist. ad Rom.,
chap. iv.), without, however, naming him. Origen twice refers to him, first in the preface to
his Comm. on the Song of Solomon, where he quotes a passage from the Epistle of Ignatius
to the Romans, and again in his sixth homily on St. Luke, where he quotes from the Epistle
to the Ephesians, both times naming the author. It is unnecessary to give later references.
Supposing the letters of Ignatius and the account of his martyrdom to be authentic, we
learn from them that he voluntarily presented himself before Trajan at Antioch, the seat of
his bishopric, when that prince was on his firstexpedition against the Parthians and Armeni-
ans (a.d. 107); and on professing himself a Christian, was condemned to the wild beasts.
After a long and dangerous voyage he came to Smyrna, of which Polycarp was bishop, and
thence wrote his four Epistles to the Ephesians, the Magnesians, the Trallians, and the Ro-
mans. From Smyrna he came to Troas, and tarrying there a few days, he wrote to the Phil-

adelphians, the Smyrnæans, and Polycarp. He then came on to Neapolis, and passed through
the whole of Macedonia. Finding a ship at Dyrrachium in Epirus about to sail into Italy, he
embarked, and crossing the Adriatic, was brought to Rome, where he perished on the 20th
of December 107, or, as some think, who deny a twofold expedition of Trajan against the
Parthians, on the same day of the year a.d. 116.

For if I in this brief space of time, have enjoyed such fellowship with your bishop —I
mean not of a mere human, but of a spiritual nature—how much more do I reckon you
happy who are so joined to him as the Church is to Jesus Christ, and as Jesus Christ is to
the Father, that so all things may agree in unity! Let no man deceive himself: if any one be
not within the altar, he is deprived of the bread of God. For if the prayer of one or two pos-
sesses^38 such power, how much more that of the bishop and the whole Church! He, therefore,
that does not assemble with the Church, has even^39 by this manifested his pride, and con-
demned himself. For it is written, “God resisteth the proud.”^40 Let us be careful, then, not
to set ourselves in opposition to the bishop, in order that we may be subject to God.

one or two possesses^42 such power that Christ stands in the midst of them, how much more

prevail for the granting of all their petitions in Christ! He, therefore, that separates himself
from such, and does not meet in the society where sacrifices^43 are offered, and with “the
Church of the first-born whose names are written in heaven,” is a wolf in sheep’s clothing,^44
while he presents a mild outward appearance. Do ye, beloved, be careful to be subject to the
bishop, and the presbyters and the deacons. For he that is subject to these is obedient to
Christ, who has appointed them; but he that is disobedient to these is disobedient to Christ
Jesus. And “he that obeyeth not^45 the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth
on him.” For he that yields not obedience to his superiors is self-confident, quarrelsome,
and proud. But “God,” says [the Scripture] “resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the
humble;”^46 and, “The proud have greatly transgressed.” The Lord also says to the priests,
“He that heareth you, heareth Me; and he that heareth Me, heareth the Father that sent Me.

Now the more any one sees the bishop keeping silence,^47 the more ought he to revere

himself greatly commends your good order in God, that ye all live according to the truth,
and that no sect^49 has any dwelling-place among you. Nor, indeed, do ye hearken to any
one rather than to Jesus Christ speaking in truth.

both of flesh and spirit; both made and not made; God existing in flesh; true life in death;
both of Mary and of God; first possible and then impossible,—^54 even Jesus Christ our Lord.
But some most worthless persons are in the habit of carrying about the name [of Jesus
Christ] in wicked guile, while yet they practise things unworthy of God, and hold opinions
contrary to the doctrine of Christ, to their own destruction, and that of those who give
credit to them, whom you must avoid as ye would wild beasts. For “the righteous man who
avoids them is saved for ever; but the destruction of the ungodly is sudden, and a subject of
rejoicing.”^55 For “they are dumb dogs, that cannot bark,”^56 raving mad, and biting secretly,
against whom ye must be on your guard, since they labour under an incurable disease. But
our Physician is the only true God, the unbegotten and unapproachable, the Lord of all, the
Father and Begetter of the only-begotten Son. We have also as a Physician the Lord our
God, Jesus the Christ, the only-begotten Son and Word, before time began,^57 but who after-
wards became also man, of Mary the virgin. For “the Word was made flesh.”^58 Being incor-
poreal, He was in the body; being impassible, He was in a passible body; being immortal,
He was in a mortal body; being life, He became subject to corruption, that He might free
our souls from death and corruption, and heal them, and might restore them to health,
when they were diseased with ungodliness and wicked lusts.

Let not then any one deceive you, as indeed ye are not deceived, inasmuch as ye are
wholly devoted to God. For since there is no strife raging among you which might distress
you, ye are certainly living in accordance with God’s will. I am far inferior to you, and require
to be sanctified by your Church of Ephesus, so renowned throughout the world. They that
are carnal cannot do those things which are spiritual, nor they that are spiritual the things


53


which are carnal; even as faith cannot do the works of unbelief, nor unbelief the works of
faith. But even those things which ye do according to the flesh are spiritual; for ye do all
things in Jesus Christ.
Let not then any one deceive you, as indeed ye are not deceived; for ye are wholly devoted
to God. For when there is no evil desire within you, which might defile and torment you,
then do ye live in accordance with the will of God, and are [the servants] of Christ. Cast ye
out that which defiles^59 you, who are of the^60 most holy Church of the Ephesians, which is
so famous and celebrated throughout the world. They that are carnal cannot do those things
which are spiritual, nor they that are spiritual the things which are carnal; even as faith
cannot do the works of unbelief, nor unbelief the works of faith. But ye, being full of the
Holy Spirit, do nothing according to the flesh, but all things according to the Spirit. Ye are
complete in Christ Jesus, “who is the Saviour of all men, specially of them that believe.”^61

#### Chapter IX.—Ye have given no heed to false teachers.


Nevertheless, I have heard of some who have passed on from this to you, having false
doctrine, whom ye did not suffer to sow among you, but stopped your ears, that ye might
not receive those things which were sown by them, as being stones^62 of the temple of the
Father, prepared for the building of God the Father, and drawn up on high by the instrument
of Jesus Christ, which is the cross,^63 making use of the Holy Spirit as a rope, while your faith
was the means by which you ascended, and your love the way which led up to God. Ye,
therefore, as well as all your fellow-travellers, are God-bearers, temple-bearers, Christ-
bearers, bearers of holiness, adorned in all respects with the commandments of Jesus Christ,
in whom also I exult that I have been thought worthy, by means of this Epistle, to converse
and rejoice with you, because with respect to your Christian life^64 ye love nothing but God
only.
Nevertheless, I have heard of some who have passed in among you, holding the wicked
doctrine of the strange and evil spirit; to whom ye did not allow entrance to sow their tares,
but stopped your ears that ye might not receive that error which was proclaimed by them,
as being persuaded that that spirit which deceives the people does not speak the things of
Christ, but his own, for he is a lying spirit. But the Holy Spirit does not speak His own things,
but those of Christ, and that not from himself, but from the Lord; even as the Lord also an-
nounced to us the things that He received from the Father. For, says He, “the word which
ye hear is not Mine, but the Father’s, who sent Me.”^65 And says He of the Holy Spirit, “He
shall not speak of Himself, but whatsoever things He shall hear from Me.”^66 And He says
of Himself to the Father, “I have,” says He, “glorified Thee upon the earth; I have finished
the work which, Thou gavest Me; I have manifested Thy name to men.”^67 And of the Holy
Ghost, “He shall glorify Me, for He receives of Mine.”^68 But the spirit of deceit preaches
himself, and speaks his own things, for he seeks to please himself. He glorifies himself, for
he is full of arrogance. He is lying, fraudulent, soothing, flattering, treacherous, rhapsodical,
trifling, inharmonious, verbose, sordid, and timorous. From his power Jesus Christ will
deliver you, who has founded you upon the rock, as being chosen stones, well fitted for the
divine edifice of the Father, and who are raised up on high by Christ, who was crucified for
you, making use of the Holy Spirit as a rope, and being borne up by faith, while exalted by

love from earth to heaven, walking in company with those that are undefiled. For, says [the
Scripture], “Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the Lord.”^69 Now
the way is unerring, namely, Jesus Christ. For, says He, “I am the way and the life.”^70 And
this way leads to the Father. For “no man,” says He, “cometh to the Father but by Me.”^71
Blessed, then, are ye who are God-bearers, spirit-bearers, temple-bearers, bearers of holiness,
adorned in all respects with the commandments of Jesus Christ, being “a royal priesthood,
a holy nation, a peculiar people,”^72 on whose account I rejoice exceedingly, and have had
the privilege, by this Epistle, of conversing with “the saints which are at Ephesus, the faithful
in Christ Jesus.”^73 I rejoice, therefore, over you, that ye do not give heed to vanity, and love
nothing according to the flesh, but according to God.

#### Chapter X.—Exhortations to prayer, humility, etc.


And pray ye without ceasing in behalf of other men. For there is in them hope of repent-


54


ance that they may attain to God. See,^74 then, that they be instructed by your works, if in
no other way. Be ye meek in response to their wrath, humble in opposition to their boasting:
to their blasphemies return^75 your prayers; in contrast to their error, be ye stedfast^76 in the
faith; and for their cruelty, manifest your gentleness. While we take care not to imitate their
conduct, let us be found their brethren in all true kindness; and let us seek to be followers
of the Lord (who ever more unjustly treated, more destitute, more condemned?), that so no
plant of the devil may be found in you, but ye may remain in all holiness and sobriety in
Jesus Christ, both with respect to the flesh and spirit.
And pray ye without ceasing in behalf of other men; for there is hope of the repentance,
that they may attain to God. For “cannot he that falls arise again, and he that goes astray
return?”^77 Permit them, then, to be instructed by you. Be ye therefore the ministers of God,
and the mouth of Christ. For thus saith the Lord, “If ye take forth the precious from the vile,
ye shall be as my mouth.”^78 Be ye humble in response to their wrath; oppose to their blas-
phemies your earnest prayers; while they go astray, stand ye stedfast in the faith. Conquer
ye their harsh temper by gentleness, their passion by meekness. For “blessed are the meek;”^79
and Moses was meek above all men;^80 and David was exceeding meek.^81 Wherefore Paul
exhorts as follows: “The servant of the Lord must not strive, but be gentle towards all men,
apt to teach, patient, in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves.”^82 Do not seek
to avenge yourselves on those that injure you, for says [the Scripture], “If I have returned
evil to those who returned evil to me.”^83 Let us make them brethren by our kindness. For
say ye to those that hate you, Ye are our brethren, that the name of the Lord may be glorified.
And let us imitate the Lord, “who, when He was reviled, reviled not again;”^84 when He was
crucified, He answered not; “when He suffered, He threatened not;”^85 but prayed for His

The last times are come upon us. Let us therefore be of a reverent spirit, and fear the

of the wrath to come, or show regard for the grace which is at present displayed— one of
two things. Only [in one way or another] let us be found in Christ Jesus unto the true life.
Apart from Him, let nothing attract^88 you, for whom I bear about these bonds, these spir-
itual jewels, by which may I arise through your prayers, of which I entreat I may always be
a partaker, that I may be found in the lot of the Christians of Ephesus, who have always been
of the same mind with the apostles through the power of Jesus Christ.
The last times are come upon us. Let us therefore be of a reverent spirit, and fear the
long-suffering of God, lest we despise the riches of His goodness and forbearance.^89 For let
us either fear the wrath to come, or let us love the present joy in the life that now is; and let
our present and true joy be only this, to be found in Christ Jesus, that we may truly live. Do
not at any time desire so much as even to breathe apart from Him. For He is my hope; He
is my boast; He is my never-failing riches, on whose account I bear about with me these
bonds from Syria to Rome, these spiritual jewels, in which may I be perfected through your
prayers, and become a partaker of the sufferings of Christ, and have fellowship with Him
in His death, His resurrection from the dead, and His everlasting life.^90 May I attain to this,
so that I may be found in the lot of the Christians of Ephesus, who have always had inter-
course with the apostles by the power of Jesus Christ, with Paul, and John, and Timothy the
most faithful.

Abel”^94 to the blood of Ignatius. Ye are initiated into the mysteries of the Gospel with Paul,

#### Chapter XIV.—Exhortations to faith and love.


None of these things is hid from you, if ye perfectly possess that faith and love towards
Christ Jesus^100 which are the beginning and the end of life. For the beginning is faith, and
the end is love.^101 Now these two, being inseparably connected together,^102 are of God,
while all other things which are requisite for a holy life follow after them. No man [truly]
making a profession of faith sinneth;^103 nor does he that possesses love hate any one. The
tree is made manifest by its fruit;^104 so those that profess themselves to be Christians shall
be recognised by their conduct. For there is not now a demand for mere profession,^105 but
that a man be found continuing in the power of faith to the end.
Wherefore none of the devices of the devil shall be hidden from you, if, like Paul, ye
perfectly possess that faith and love towards Christ^106 which are the beginning and the end
of life. The beginning of life is faith, and the end is love. And these two being inseparably
connected together, do perfect the man of God; while all other things which are requisite
to a holy life follow after them. No man making a profession of faith ought to sin, nor one
possessed of love to hate his brother. For He that said, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God,”^107
said also, “and thy neighbour as thyself.”^108 Those that profess themselves to be Christ’s are
known not only by what they say, but by what they practise. “For the tree is known by its
fruit.”^109

It is better for a man to be silent and be [a Christian], than to talk and not to be one. It
is good to teach, if he who speaks also acts. There is then one Teacher, who spake and it was


56


done; while even those things which He did in silence are worthy of the Father. He who
possesses the word of Jesus, is truly able to hear even His very silence, that he may be perfect,
and may both act as he speaks, and be recognised by his silence. There is nothing which is
hid from God, but our very secrets are near to Him. Let us therefore do all things as those
who have Him dwelling in us, that we may be His temples,^110 and He may be in us as our
God, which indeed He is, and will manifest Himself before our faces. Wherefore we justly
love Him.
It is better for a man to be silent and be [a Christian], than to talk and not to be one.
“The kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.”^111 Men “believe with the heart, and
confess with the mouth,” the one “unto righteousness,” the other “unto salvation.”^112 It is
good to teach, if he who speaks also acts. For he who shall both “do and teach, the same
shall be great in the kingdom.”^113 Our Lord and God, Jesus Christ, the Son of the living
God, first did and then taught, as Luke testifies, “whose praise is in the Gospel through all
the Churches.”^114 There is nothing which is hid from the Lord, but our very secrets are near
to Him. Let us therefore do all things as those who have Him dwelling in us, that we may
be His temples,^115 and He may be in us as God. Let Christ speak in us, even as He did in
Paul. Let the Holy Spirit teach us to speak the things of Christ in like manner as He did.

more shall this be the case with any one who corrupts by wicked doctrine the faith of God,
for which Jesus Christ was crucified! Such an one becoming defiled [in this way], shall go
away into everlasting fire, and so shall every one that hearkens unto him.

much more shall those suffer everlasting punishment who endeavour to corrupt the Church
of Christ, for which the Lord Jesus, the only-begotten Son of God, endured the cross, and
submitted to death! Whosoever, “being waxen fat,”^120 and “become gross,” sets at nought
His doctrine, shall go into hell. In like manner, every one that has received from God the
power of distinguishing, and yet follows an unskilful shepherd, and receives a false opinion
for the truth, shall be punished. “What communion hath light with darkness? or Christ with
Belial? Or what portion hath he that believeth with an infidel? or the temple of God with
idols?”^121 And in like manner say I, what communion hath truth with falsehood? or right-
eousness with unrighteousness? or true doctrine with that which is false?

For this end did the Lord suffer the ointment to be poured upon His head,^122 that He

doctrine of the prince of this world; let him not lead you away captive from the life which
is set before you. And why are we not all prudent, since we have received the knowledge of
God, which is Jesus Christ? Why do we foolishly perish, not recognising the gift which the
Lord has of a truth sent to us?
For this end did the Lord suffer the ointment to be poured upon His head,^123 that His
Church might breathe forth immortality. For saith [the Scripture], “Thy name is as ointment
poured forth; therefore have the virgins loved Thee; they have drawn Thee; at the odour of
Thine ointments we will run after Thee.”^124 Let no one be anointed with the bad odour of
the doctrine of [the prince of] this world; let not the holy Church of God be led captive by
his subtlety, as was the first woman.^125 Why do we not, as gifted with reason, act wisely?
When we had received from Christ, and had grafted in us the faculty of judging concerning
God, why do we fall headlong into ignorance? and why, through a careless neglect of acknow-
ledging the gift which we have received, do we foolishly perish?

man? where the disputer?”^128 Where is the boasting of those who are styled prudent? For
our God, Jesus Christ, was, according to the appointment^129 of God, conceived in the womb
by Mary, of the seed of David, but by the Holy Ghost. He was born and baptized, that by
His passion He might purify the water.
The cross of Christ is indeed a stumbling-block to those that do not believe, but to the
believing it is salvation and life eternal. “Where is the wise man? where the disputer?”^130
Where is the boasting of those who are called mighty? For the Son of God, who was begotten
before time began,^131 and established all things according to the will of the Father, He was
conceived in the womb of Mary, according to the appointment of God, of the seed of David,
and by the Holy Ghost. For says [the Scripture], “Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and
shall bring forth a son, and He shall be called Immanuel.”^132 He was born and was baptized
by John, that He might ratify the institution committed to that prophet.

Now the virginity of Mary was hidden from the prince of this world, as was also her

silence by^134 God. How, then, was He manifested to the world?^135 A star shone forth in
heaven above all the other stars, the light of which was inexpressible, while its novelty struck
men with astonishment. And all the rest of the stars, with the sun and moon, formed a
chorus to this star, and its light was exceedingly great above them all. And there was agitation
felt as to whence this new spectacle came, so unlike to everything else [in the heavens].
Hence every kind of magic was destroyed, and every bond of wickedness disappeared; ignor-
ance was removed, and the old kingdom abolished, God Himself being manifested in human
form for the renewal of eternal life. And now that took a beginning which had been prepared
by God. Henceforth all things were in a state of tumult, because He meditated the abolition
of death.

### Chapter I.—Reason of writing the epistle.


Havingbeen informed of your godly^152 love, so well-ordered, I rejoiced greatly, and
determined to commune with you in the faith of Jesus Christ. For as one who has been
thought worthy of the most honourable of all names,^153 in those bonds which I bear about,
I commend the Churches, in which I pray for a union both of the flesh and spirit of Jesus
Christ, the constant source of our life, and of faith and love, to which nothing is to be pre-
ferred, but especially of Jesus and the Father, in whom, if we endure all the assaults of the
prince of this world, and escape them, we shall enjoy God.

were redeemed; by whom ye have known God, or rather have been known by Him;^156 in

### Chapter III.—Honour your youthful bishop.


Now it becomes you also not to treat your bishop too familiarly on account of his
youth,^163 but to yield him all reverence, having respect to^164 the power of God the Father,
as I have known even holy presbyters do, not judging rashly, from the manifest youthful
appearance^165 [of their bishop], but as being themselves prudent in God, submitting to him,
or rather not to him, but to the Father of Jesus Christ, the bishop of us all. It is therefore
fitting that you should, after no hypocritical fashion, obey [your bishop], in honour of Him
who has willed us [so to do], since he that does not so deceives not [by such conduct] the
bishop that is visible, but seeks to mock Him that is invisible. And all such conduct has ref-
erence not to man,^166 but to God, who knows all secrets.
Now it becomes you also not to despise the age of your bishop, but to yield him all rev-
erence, according to the will of God the Father, as I have known even holy presbyters do,
not having regard to the manifest youth [of their bishop], but to his knowledge in God;
inasmuch as “not the ancient are [necessarily] wise, nor do the aged understand prudence;
but there is a spirit in men.”^167 For Daniel the wise, at twelve years of age, became possessed
of the divine Spirit, and convicted the elders, who in vain carried their grey hairs, of being
false accusers, and of lusting after the beauty of another man’s wife.^168 Samuel also, when
he was but a little child, reproved Eli, who was ninety years old, for giving honour to his
sons rather than to God.^169 In like manner, Jeremiah also received this message from God,
“Say not, I am a child.”^170 Solomon too, and Josiah, [exemplified the same thing.] The
former, being made king at twelve years of age, gave that terrible and difficult judgment in
the case of the two women concerning their children.^171 The latter, coming to the throne
when eight years old^172 cast down the altars and temples [of the idols], and burned down
the groves, for they were dedicated to demons, and not to God. And he slew the false priests,
as the corrupters and deceivers of men, and not the worshippers of the Deity. Wherefore
youth is not to be despised when it is devoted to God. But he is to be despised who is of a
wicked mind, although he be old, and full of wicked days.^173 Timothy the Christ-bearer was


163 Literally, “to use the age of your bishop.”

young, but hear what his teacher writes to him: “Let no man despise thy youth, but be thou
an example of the believers in word and in conduct.”^174 It is becoming, therefore, that ye
also should be obedient to your bishop, and contradict him in nothing; for it is a fearful
thing to contradict any such person. For no one does [by such conduct] deceive him that is
visible, but does [in reality] seek to mock Him that is invisible, who, however, cannot be
mocked by any one. And every such act has respect not to man, but to God. For God says
to Samuel, “They have not mocked thee, but Me.”^175 And Moses declares, “For their mur-
muring is not against us, but against the Lord God.”^176 No one of those has, [in fact,] re-
mained unpunished, who rose up against their superiors. For Dathan and Abiram did not
speak against the law, but against Moses,^177 and were cast down alive into Hades. Korah
also,^178 and the two hundred and fifty who conspired with him against Aaron, were destroyed
by fire. Absalom, again,^179 who had slain his brother, became suspended on a tree, and had
his evil-designing heart thrust through with darts. In like manner was Abeddadan^180 be-
headed for the same reason. Uzziah,^181 when he presumed to oppose the priests and the
priesthood, was smitten with leprosy. Saul also was dishonoured,^182 because he did not wait
for Samuel the high priest. It behoves you, therefore, also to reverence your superiors.

### Chapter IV.—Some wickedly act independently of the bishop.


It is fitting, then, not only to be called Christians, but to be so in reality: as some indeed
give one the title of bishop, but do all things without him. Now such persons seem to me to
be not possessed of a good conscience, seeing they are not stedfastly gathered together ac-
cording to the commandment.
It is fitting, then, not only to be called Christians, but to be so in reality. For it is not the
being called so, but the being really so, that renders a man blessed. To those who indeed
talk of the bishop, but do all things without him, will He who is the true and first Bishop,
and the only High Priest by nature, declare, “Why call ye Me Lord, and do not the things
which I say?”^183 For such persons seem to me not possessed of a good conscience, but to
be simply dissemblers and hypocrites.

### Chapter V.—Death is the fate of all such.


Seeing, then, all things have an end, these two things are simultaneously set before
us—death and life; and every one shall go unto his own place. For as there are two kinds of
coins, the one of God, the other of the world, and each of these has its special character
stamped upon it, [so is it also here.]^184 The unbelieving are of this world; but the believing
have, in love, the character of God the Father by Jesus Christ, by whom, if we are not in
readiness to die into His passion,^185 His life is not in us.
Seeing, then, all things have an end, and there is set before us life upon our observance
[of God’s precepts], but death as the result of disobedience, and every one, according to the
choice he makes, shall go to his own place, let us flee from death, and make choice of life.
For I remark, that two different characters are found among men—the one true coin, the
other spurious. The truly devout man is the right kind of coin, stamped by God Himself.
The ungodly man, again, is false coin, unlawful, spurious, counterfeit, wrought not by God,
but by the devil. I do not mean to say that there are two different human natures, but that
there is one humanity, sometimes belonging to God, and sometimes to the devil. If any one
is truly religious, he is a man of God; but if he is irreligious, he is a man of the devil, made
such, not by nature, but by his own choice. The unbelieving bear the image of the prince of
wickedness. The believing possess the image of their Prince, God the Father, and Jesus
Christ, through whom, if we are not in readiness to die for the truth into His passion,^186
His life is not in us.

### Chapter VI.—Preserve harmony.


Since therefore I have, in the persons before mentioned, beheld the whole multitude of
you in faith and love, I exhort you to study to do all things with a divine harmony,^187 while
your bishop presides in the place of God, and your presbyters in the place of the assembly
of the apostles, along with your deacons, who are most dear to me, and are entrusted with
the ministry of Jesus Christ, who was with the Father before the beginning of time,^188 and
in the end was revealed. Do ye all then, imitating the same divine conduct,^189 pay respect
to one another, and let no one look upon his neighbour after the flesh, but do ye continually
love each other in Jesus Christ. Let nothing exist among you that may divide you; but be ye
united with your bishop, and those that preside over you, as a type and evidence of your
immortality.^190
Since therefore I have, in the persons before mentioned, beheld the whole multitude of

your bishop presides in the place of God, and your presbyters in the place of the assembly
of the apostles, along with your deacons, who are most dear to me, and are entrusted with
the ministry of Jesus Christ. He, being begotten by the Father before the beginning of time,^192
was God the Word, the only-begotten Son, and remains the same for ever; for “of His
kingdom there shall be no end,”^193 says Daniel the prophet. Let us all therefore love one
another in harmony, and let no one look upon his neighbour according to the flesh, but in
Christ Jesus. Let nothing exist among you which may divide you; but be ye united with your
bishop, being through him subject to God in Christ.

### Chapter VII.—Do nothing without the bishop and presbyters.


As therefore the Lord did nothing without the Father, being united to Him, neither by
Himself nor by the apostles, so neither do ye anything without the bishop and presbyters.
Neither endeavour that anything appear reasonable and proper to yourselves apart; but being
come together into the same place, let there be one prayer, one supplication, one mind, one
hope, in love and in joy undefiled. There is one Jesus Christ, than whom nothing is more
excellent. Do ye therefore all run together as into one temple of God, as to one altar, as to
one Jesus Christ, who came forth from one Father, and is with and has gone to one.
As therefore the Lord does nothing without the Father, for says He, “I can of mine own
self do nothing,”^194 so do ye, neither presbyter, nor deacon, nor layman, do anything without
the bishop. Nor let anything appear commendable to you which is destitute of his approval.^195
For every such thing is sinful, and opposed [to the will of] God. Do ye all come together
into the same place for prayer. Let there be one common supplication, one mind, one hope,
with faith unblameable in Christ Jesus, than which nothing is more excellent. Do ye all, as
one man, run together into the temple of God, as unto one altar, to one Jesus Christ, the
High Priest of the unbegotten God.

### Chapter VIII.—Caution against false doctrines.


Be not deceived with strange doctrines, nor with old fables, which are unprofitable. For
if we still live according to the Jewish law, we acknowledge that we have not received grace.
For the divinest prophets lived according to Christ Jesus. On this account also they were
persecuted, being inspired by His grace to fully convince the unbelieving that there is one
God, who has manifested Himself by Jesus Christ His Son, who is His eternal Word, not
proceeding forth from silence,^196 and who in all things pleased Him that sent Him.
Be not deceived with strange doctrines, “nor give heed to fables and endless genealo-
gies,”^197 and things in which the Jews make their boast. “Old things are passed away: behold,
all things have become new.”^198 For if we still live according to the Jewish law, and the cir-
cumcision of the flesh, we deny that we have received grace. For the divinest prophets lived
according to Jesus Christ. On this account also they were persecuted, being inspired by grace
to fully convince the unbelieving that there is one God, the Almighty, who has manifested
Himself by Jesus Christ His Son, who is His Word, not spoken, but essential. For He is not
the voice of an articulate utterance, but a substance begotten by divine power, who has in
all things pleased Him that sent Him.^199

### Chapter IX.—Let us live with Christ.


If, therefore, those who were brought up in the ancient order of things^200 have come
to the possession of a new^201 hope, no longer observing the Sabbath, but living in the ob-
servance^202 of the Lord’s Day, on which also our life has sprung up again by Him and by
His death—whom some deny, by which mystery we have obtained faith,^203 and therefore
endure, that we may be found the disciples of Jesus Christ, our only Master—how shall we
be able to live apart from Him, whose disciples the prophets themselves in the Spirit did
wait for Him as their Teacher? And therefore He whom they rightly waited for, being come,
raised them from the dead.^204
If, then, those who were conversant with the ancient Scriptures came to newness of
hope, expecting the coming of Christ, as the Lord teaches us when He says, “If ye had believed
Moses, ye would have believed Me, for he wrote of Me;”^205 and again, “Your father Abraham
rejoiced to see My day, and he saw it, and was glad; for before Abraham was, I am;”^206 how
shall we be able to live without Him? The prophets were His servants, and foresaw Him by
the Spirit, and waited for Him as their Teacher, and expected Him as their Lord and Saviour,
saying, “He will come and save us.”^207 Let us therefore no longer keep the Sabbath after the
Jewish manner, and rejoice in days of idleness; for “he that does not work, let him not eat.”^208
For say the [holy] oracles, “In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat thy bread.”^209 But let every
one of you keep the Sabbath after a spiritual manner, rejoicing in meditation on the law,
not in relaxation of the body, admiring the workmanship of God, and not eating things
prepared the day before, nor using lukewarm drinks, and walking within a prescribed space,
nor finding delight in dancing and plaudits which have no sense in them.^210 And after the
observance of the Sabbath, let every friend of Christ keep the Lord’s Day as a festival, the
resurrection-day, the queen and chief of all the days [of the week]. Looking forward to this,

again, and the victory over death was obtained in Christ, whom the children of perdition,
the enemies of the Saviour, deny, “whose god is their belly, who mind earthly things,”^212
who are “lovers of pleasure, and not lovers of God, having a form of godliness, but denying
the power thereof.”^213 These make merchandise of Christ, corrupting His word, and giving
up Jesus to sale: they are corrupters of women, and covetous of other men’s possessions,
swallowing up wealth^214 insatiably; from whom may ye be delivered by the mercy of God
through our Lord Jesus Christ!

### Chapter X.—Beware of Judaizing.


Let us not, therefore, be insensible to His kindness. For were He to reward us according
to our works, we should cease to be. Therefore, having become His disciples, let us learn to
live according to the principles of Christianity.^215 For whosoever is called by any other name
besides this, is not of God. Lay aside, therefore, the evil, the old, the sour leaven, and be ye
changed into the new leaven, which is Jesus Christ. Be ye salted in Him, lest any one among
you should be corrupted, since by your savour ye shall be convicted. It is absurd to profess^216
Christ Jesus, and to Judaize. For Christianity did not embrace^217 Judaism, but Judaism
Christianity, that so every tongue which believeth might be gathered together to God.
Let us not, therefore, be insensible to His kindness. For were He to reward us according
to our works, we should cease to be. For “if Thou, Lord, shalt mark iniquities, O Lord, who
shall stand?”^218 Let us therefore prove ourselves worthy of that name which we have received.
For whosoever is called by any other name besides this, he is not of God; for he has not re-
ceived the prophecy which speaks thus concerning us: “The people shall be called by a new
name, which the Lord shall name them, and shall be a holy people.”^219 This was first fulfilled
in Syria; for “the disciples were called Christians at Antioch,”^220 when Paul and Peter were
laying the foundations of the Church. Lay aside, therefore, the evil, the old, the corrupt
leaven,^221 and be ye changed into the new leaven of grace. Abide in Christ, that the
stranger^222 may not have dominion over you. It is absurd to speak of Jesus Christ with the
tongue, and to cherish in the mind a Judaism which has now come to an end. For where
there is Christianity there cannot be Judaism. For Christ is one, in whom every nation that
believes, and every tongue that confesses, is gathered unto God. And those that were of a
stony heart have become the children of Abraham, the friend of God;^223 and in his seed all
those have been blessed^224 who were ordained to eternal life^225 in Christ.

was begotten by the Father before all ages, but was afterwards born of the Virgin Mary
without any intercourse with man. He also lived a holy life, and healed every kind of sickness
and disease among the people, and wrought signs and wonders for the benefit of men; and
to those who had fallen into the error of polytheism He made known the one and only true
God, His Father, and underwent the passion, and endured the cross at the hands of the
Christ-killing Jews, under Pontius Pilate the governor and Herod the king. He also died,
and rose again, and ascended into the heavens to Him that sent Him, and is sat down at His
right hand, and shall come at the end of the world, with His Father’s glory, to judge the living
and the dead, and to render to every one according to his works.^229 He who knows these

the flesh, and blood, and passion of Jesus Christ, who is our hope, through our rising again to
Him,^248 which also I salute in its fulness,^249 and in the apostolical character,^250 and wish
abundance of happiness.

### Chapter I.—Acknowledgment of their excellence.


I knowthat ye possess an unblameable and sincere mind in patience, and that not only
in present practice,^253 but according to inherent nature, as Polybius your bishop has shown
me, who has come to Smyrna by the will of God and Jesus Christ, and so sympathized in
the joy which I, who am bound in Christ Jesus, possess, that I beheld your whole multitude
in him. Having therefore received through him the testimony of your good-will, according
to God, I gloried to find you, as I knew you were, the followers of God.
I knowthat ye possess an unblameable and sincere mind in patience, and that not only
for present use,^254 but as a permanent possession, as Polybius your bishop has shown me,

with the co-operation of the Spirit, and so sympathized in the joy which I, who am bound
in Christ Jesus, possess, that I beheld your whole multitude in Him. Having therefore received
through him the testimony of your good-will according to God, I gloried to find that you
were the followers of Jesus Christ the Saviour.

### Chapter II.—Be subject to the bishop, etc.


For, since ye are subject to the bishop as to Jesus Christ, ye appear to me to live not after
the manner of men, but according to Jesus Christ, who died for us, in order, by believing
in His death, ye may escape from death. It is therefore necessary that, as ye indeed do, so


67


without the bishop ye should do nothing, but should also be subject to the presbytery, as
to the apostle of Jesus Christ, who is our hope, in whom, if we live, we shall [at last] be found.
It is fitting also that the deacons, as being [the ministers] of the mysteries of Jesus Christ,
should in every respect be pleasing to all.^255 For they are not ministers of meat and drink,
but servants of the Church of God. They are bound, therefore, to avoid all grounds of accus-
ation [against them], as they would do fire.
Be ye subject to the bishop as to the Lord, for “he watches for your souls, as one that
shall give account to God.”^256 Wherefore also, ye appear to me to live not after the manner
of men, but according to Jesus Christ, who died for us, in order that, by believing in His
death, ye may by baptism be made partakers of His resurrection. It is therefore necessary,
whatsoever things ye do, to do nothing without the bishop. And be ye subject also to the
presbytery, as to the apostles of Jesus Christ, who is our hope, in whom, if we live, we shall
be found in Him. It behoves you also, in every way, to please the deacons, who are [ministers]
of the mysteries of Christ Jesus; for they are not ministers of meat and drink, but servants
of the Church of God. They are bound, therefore, to avoid all grounds of accusation [against
them], as they would a burning fire. Let them, then, prove themselves to be such.


255 It is doubtful whether this exhortation is addressed to the deacons or people; whether the former are
urged in all respects to please the latter, or the latter in all points to be pleased with the former.

### Chapter III.—Honour the deacons, etc.


In like manner, let all reverence the deacons as an appointment^257 of Jesus Christ, and
the bishop as Jesus Christ, who is the Son of the Father, and the presbyters as the sanhedrim
of God, and assembly of the apostles. Apart from these, there is no Church.^258 Concerning
all this, I am persuaded that ye are of the same opinion. For I have received the manifesta-
tion^259 of your love, and still have it with me, in your bishop, whose very appearance is
highly instructive,^260 and his meekness of itself a power; whom I imagine even the ungodly
must reverence, seeing they are^261 also pleased that I do not spare myself. But shall I, when
permitted to write on this point, reach such a height of self-esteem, that though being a
condemned^262 man, I should issue commands to you as if I were an apostle?
And do ye reverence them as Christ Jesus, of whose place they are the keepers, even as
the bishop is the representative of the Father of all things, and the presbyters are the san-
hedrim of God, and assembly^263 of the apostles of Christ. Apart from these there is no elect
Church, no congregation of holy ones, no assembly of saints. I am persuaded that ye also
are of this opinion. For I have received the manifestation^264 of your love, and still have it
with me, in your bishop, whose very appearance is highly instructive, and his meekness of
itself a power; whom I imagine even the ungodly must reverence. Loving you as I do, I avoid
writing in any severer strain to you, that I may not seem harsh to any, or wanting [in tender-
ness]. I am indeed bound for the sake of Christ, but I am not yet worthy of Christ. But when
I am perfected, perhaps I shall then become so. I do not issue orders like an apostle.

### Chapter IV.—I have need of humility.


I have great knowledge in God,^265 but I restrain myself, lest, I should perish through
boasting. For now it is needful for me to be the more fearful; and not give heed to those that
puff me up. For they that speak to me [in the way of commendation] scourge me. For I do
indeed desire to suffer, but I know not if I be worthy to do so. For this longing, though it is
not manifest to many, all the more vehemently assails me.^266 I therefore have need of
meekness, by which the prince of this world is brought to nought.
But I measure myself, that I may not perish through boasting: but it is good to glory in
the Lord.^267 And even though I were established^268 in things pertaining to God, yet then
would it befit me to be the more fearful, and not give heed to those that vainly puff me up.
For those that commend me scourge me. [I do indeed desire to suffer^269 ], but I know not
if I be worthy to do so. For the envy of the wicked one is not visible to many, but it wars
against me. I therefore have need of meekness, by which the devil, the prince of this world,
is brought to nought.

Am I not able to write to you of heavenly things? But I fear to do so, lest I should inflict
injury on you who are but babes [in Christ]. Pardon me in this respect, lest, as not being
able to receive [such doctrines], ye should be strangled by them. For even I, though I am
bound [for Christ], yet am not on that account able to understand heavenly things, and the
places^270 of the angels, and their gatherings under their respective princes, things visible
and invisible. Without reference to such abstruse subjects, I am still but a learner [in other
respects^271 ]; for many things are wanting to us, that we come not short of God.
For might^272 not I write to you things more full of mystery? But I fear to do so, lest I
should inflict injury on you who are but babes [in Christ]. Pardon me in this respect, lest,
as not being able to receive their weighty import,^273 ye should be strangled by them. For
even I, though I am bound [for Christ], and am able to understand heavenly things, the
angelic orders, and the different sorts^274 of angels and hosts, the distinctions between powers
and dominions, and the diversities between thrones and authorities, the mightiness of the
Æons, and the pre-eminence of the cherubim and seraphim, the sublimity of the spirit, the
kingdom of the Lord, and above all, the incomparable majesty of Almighty God—though
I am acquainted with these things, yet am I not therefore by any means perfect; nor am I
such a disciple as Paul or Peter. For many things are yet wanting to me, that I may not fall
short of God.

### Chapter VI.—Abstain from the poison of heretics.


I therefore, yet not I, but the love of Jesus Christ, entreat you that ye use Christian
nourishment only, and abstain from herbage of a different kind; I mean heresy. For those^275
[that are given to this] mix^276 up Jesus Christ with their own poison, speaking things which
are unworthy of credit, like those who administer a deadly drug in sweet wine, which he
who is ignorant of does greedily^277 take, with a fatal pleasure^278 leading to his own death.
I therefore, yet not I, out the love of Jesus Christ, “entreat you that ye all speak the same
thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in
the same mind, and in the same judgment.”^279 For there are some vain talkers^280 and de-
ceivers, not Christians, but Christ-betrayers,^281 bearing about the name of Christ in deceit,
and “corrupting the word”^282 of the Gospel; while they intermix the poison of their deceit
with their persuasive talk,^283 as if they mingled aconite with sweet wine, that so he who
drinks, being deceived in his taste by the very great sweetness of the draught, may incautiously
meet with his death. One of the ancients gives us this advice, “Let no man be called good
who mixes good with evil.”^284 For they speak of Christ, not that they may preach Christ,
but that they may reject Christ; and they speak^285 of the law, not that they may establish
the law, but that they may proclaim things contrary to it. For they alienate Christ from the
Father, and the law from Christ. They also calumniate His being born of the Virgin; they
are ashamed of His cross; they deny His passion; and they do not believe His resurrection.
They introduce God as a Being unknown; they suppose Christ to be unbegotten; and as to
the Spirit, they do not admit that He exists. Some of them say that the Son is a mere man,
and that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are but the same person, and that the creation is
the work of God, not by Christ, but by some other strange power.

### Chapter VII.—The same continued.


Be on your guard, therefore, against such persons. And this will be the case with you if
you are not puffed up, and continue in intimate union with^286 Jesus Christ our God, and


69


the bishop, and the enactments of the apostles. He that is within the altar is pure, but^287 he
that is without is not pure; that is, he who does anything apart from the bishop, and presby-
tery, and deacons,^288 such a man is not pure in his conscience.
Be on your guard, therefore, against such persons, that ye admit not of a snare for your
own souls. And act so that your life shall be without offence to all men, lest ye become as
“a snare upon a watch-tower, and as a net which is spread out.”^289 For “he that does not
heal himself in his own works, is the brother of him that destroys himself.”^290 If, therefore,
ye also put away conceit, arrogance, disdain, and haughtiness, it will be your privilege to be
inseparably united to God, for “He is nigh unto those that fear Him.”^291 And says He, “Upon
whom will I look, but upon him that is humble and quiet, and that trembles at my words?”^292
And do ye also reverence your bishop as Christ Himself, according as the blessed apostles
have enjoined you. He that is within the altar is pure, wherefore also he is obedient to the
bishop and presbyters: but he that is without is one that does anything apart from the bishop,
the presbyters, and the deacons. Such a person is defiled in his conscience, and is worse than
an infidel. For what is the bishop but one who beyond all others possesses all power and
authority, so far as it is possible for a man to possess it, who according to his ability has been
made an imitator of the Christ of God?^293 And what is the presbytery but a sacred assembly,
the counsellors and assessors of the bishop? And what are the deacons but imitators of the
angelic powers,^294 fulfilling a pure and blameless ministry unto him, as the holy Stephen
did to the blessed James, Timothy and Linus to Paul, Anencletus and Clement to Peter? He,
therefore, that will not yield obedience to such, must needs be one utterly without God, an
impious man who despises Christ, and depreciates His appointments.

### Chapter VIII.—Be on your guard against the snares of the devil.


Not that I know there is anything of this kind among you; but I put you on your guard,
inasmuch as I love you greatly, and foresee the snares of the devil. Wherefore, clothing^295
yourselves with meekness, be ye renewed^296 in faith, that is the flesh of the Lord, and in
love, that is the blood of Jesus Christ. Let no one of you cherish any grudge against his
neighbour. Give no occasion to the Gentiles, lest by means of a few foolish men the whole
multitude [of those that believe] in God be evil spoken of. For, “Woe to him by whose vanity
my name is blasphemed among any.”^297
Now I write these things unto you, not that I know there are any such persons among
you; nay, indeed I hope that God will never permit any such report to reach my ears, He
“who spared not His Son for the sake of His holy Church.”^298 But foreseeing the snares of
the wicked one, I arm you beforehand by my admonitions, as my beloved and faithful chil-
dren in Christ, furnishing you with the means of protection^299 against the deadly disease
of unruly men, by which do ye flee from the disease^300 [referred to] by the good-will of
Christ our Lord. Do ye therefore, clothing^301 yourselves with meekness, become the imitators
of His sufferings, and of His love, wherewith^302 He loved us when He gave Himself a
ransom^303 for us, that He might cleanse us by His blood from our old ungodliness, and be-
stow life on us when we were almost on the point of perishing through the depravity that
was in us. Let no one of you, therefore, cherish any grudge against his neighbour. For says
our Lord, “Forgive, and it shall be forgiven unto you.”^304 Give no occasion to the Gentiles,
lest “by means of a few foolish men the word and doctrine [of Christ] be blasphemed.”^305
For says the prophet, as in the person of God, “Woe to him by whom my name is blasphemed
among the Gentiles.”^306

Stop your ears, therefore, when any one speaks to you at variance with^307 Jesus Christ,
who was descended from David, and was also of Mary; who was truly born, and did eat and
drink. He was truly persecuted under Pontius Pilate; He was truly crucified, and [truly] died,
in the sight of beings in heaven, and on earth, and under the earth. He was also truly raised
from the dead, His Father quickening Him, even as after the same manner His Father will
so raise up us who believe in Him by Christ Jesus, apart from whom we do not possess the
true life.
Stop your ears, therefore, when any one speaks to you at variance with^308 Jesus Christ,
the Son of God, who was descended from David, and was also of Mary; who was truly begot-
ten of God and of the Virgin, but not after the same manner. For indeed God and man are
not the same. He truly assumed a body; for “the Word was made flesh,”^309 and lived upon
earth without sin. For says He, “Which of you convicteth me of sin?”^310 He did in reality
both eat and drink. He was crucified and died under Pontius Pilate. He really, and not merely
in appearance, was crucified, and died, in the sight of beings in heaven, and on earth, and
under the earth. By those in heaven I mean such as are possessed of incorporeal natures; by
those on earth, the Jews and Romans, and such persons as were present at that time when
the Lord was crucified; and by those under the earth, the multitude that arose along with
the Lord. For says the Scripture, “Many bodies of the saints that slept arose,”^311 their graves
being opened. He descended, indeed, into Hades alone, but He arose accompanied by a
multitude; and rent asunder that means^312 of separation which had existed from the begin-
ning of the world, and cast down its partition-wall. He also rose again in three days, the
Father raising Him up; and after spending forty days with the apostles, He was received up
to the Father, and “sat down at His right hand, expecting till His enemies are placed under
His feet.”^313 On the day of the preparation, then, at the third hour, He received the sentence
from Pilate, the Father permitting that to happen; at the sixth hour He was crucified; at the
ninth hour He gave up the ghost; and before sunset He was buried.^314 During the Sabbath
He continued under the earth in the tomb in which Joseph of Arimathæa had laid Him. At
the dawning of the Lord’s day He arose from the dead, according to what was spoken by

### Chapter X.—The reality of Christ’s passion.


But if, as some that are without God, that is, the unbelieving, say, that He only seemed
to suffer (they themselves only seeming to exist), then why am I in bonds? Why do I long
to be exposed to^316 the wild beasts? Do I therefore die in vain?^317 Am I not then guilty of
falsehood^318 against [the cross of] the Lord?
But if, as some that are without God, that is, the unbelieving, say, He became man in
appearance [only], that He did not in reality take unto Him a body, that He died in appear-
ance [merely], and did not in very deed suffer, then for what reason am I now in bonds, and
long to be exposed to^319 the wild beasts? In such a case, I die in vain, and am guilty of
falsehood^320 against the cross of the Lord. Then also does the prophet in vain declare, “They
shall look on Him whom they have pierced, and mourn over themselves as over one be-
loved.”^321 These men, therefore, are not less unbelievers than were those that crucified Him.
But as for me, I do not place my hopes in one who died for me in appearance, but in reality.
For that which is false is quite abhorrent to the truth. Mary then did truly conceive a body
which had God inhabiting it. And God the Word was truly born of the Virgin, having clothed
Himself with a body of like passions with our own. He who forms all men in the womb, was
Himself really in the womb, and made for Himself a body of the seed of the Virgin, but
without any intercourse of man. He was carried in the womb, even as we are, for the usual
period of time; and was really born, as we also are; and was in reality nourished with milk,
and partook of common meat and drink, even as we do. And when He had lived among
men for thirty years, He was baptized by John, really and not in appearance; and when He
had preached the Gospel three years, and done signs and wonders, He who was Himself the
Judge was judged by the Jews, falsely so called, and by Pilate the governor; was scourged,
was smitten on the cheek, was spit upon; He wore a crown of thorns and a purple robe; He
was condemned: He was crucified in reality, and not in appearance, not in imagination, not
in deceit. He really died, and was buried, and rose from the dead, even as He prayed in a
certain place, saying, “But do Thou, O Lord, raise me up again, and I shall recompense
them.”^322 And the Father, who always hears Him,^323 answered and said, “Arise, O God,

and judge the earth; for Thou shall receive all the heathen for Thine inheritance.”^324 The
Father, therefore, who raised Him up, will also raise us up through Him, apart from whom
no one will attain to true life. For says He, “I am the life; he that believeth in me, even though
he die, shall live: and every one that liveth and believeth in me, even though he die, shall
live for ever.”^325 Do ye therefore flee from these ungodly heresies; for they are the inventions

### Chapter XI.—Avoid the deadly errors of the Docetæ.


Flee, therefore, those evil offshoots [of Satan], which produce death-bearing fruit,
whereof if any one tastes, he instantly dies. For these men are not the planting of the Father.
For if they were, they would appear as branches of the cross, and their fruit would be incor-
ruptible. By it^326 He calls you through His passion, as being His members. The head,
therefore, cannot be born by itself, without its members; God, who is [the Saviour] Himself,
having promised their union.^327
Do ye also avoid those wicked offshoots of his,^328 Simon his firstborn son, and Menander,
and Basilides, and all his wicked mob of followers,^329 the worshippers of a man, whom also
the prophet Jeremiah pronounces accursed.^330 Flee also the impure Nicolaitanes, falsely so
called,^331 who are lovers of pleasure, and given to calumnious speeches. Avoid also the
children of the evil one, Theodotus and Cleobulus, who produce death-bearing fruit,
whereof if any one tastes, he instantly dies, and that not a mere temporary death, but one
that shall endure for ever. These men are not the planting of the Father, but are an accursed
brood. And says the Lord, “Let every plant which my heavenly Father has not planted be
rooted up.”^332 For if they had been branches of the Father, they would not have been “en-
emies of the cross of Christ,”^333 but rather of those who “killed the Lord of glory.”^334 But
now, by denying the cross, and being ashamed of the passion, they cover the transgression
of the Jews, those fighters against God, those murderers of the Lord; for it were too little to
style them merely murderers of the prophets. But Christ invites you to [share in] His immor-
tality, by His passion and resurrection, inasmuch as ye are His members.

I salute you from Smyrna, together with the Churches of God which are with me, who
have refreshed me in all things, both in the flesh and in the spirit. My bonds, which I carry
about with me for the sake of Jesus Christ (praying that I may attain to God), exhort you.
Continue in harmony among yourselves, and in prayer with one another; for it becomes
every one of you, and especially the presbyters, to refresh the bishop, to the honour of the
Father, of Jesus Christ, and of the apostles. I entreat you in love to hear me, that I may not,
by having written, be a testimony against you. And do ye also pray for me, who have need
of your love, along with the mercy of God, that I may be worthy of the lot for which I am
destined, and that I may not be found reprobate.

Church which is in Syria, from which also I am not worthy to receive my appellation, being

to the command [of God], and in like manner to the presbytery. And do ye, every man, love
one another with an undivided heart. Let my spirit be sanctified^336 by yours, not only now,
but also when I shall attain to God. For I am as yet exposed to danger. But the Father is
faithful in Jesus Christ to fulfil both mine and your petitions: in whom may ye be found
unblameable.

Throughprayer^342 to God I have obtained the privilege of seeing your most worthy
faces,^343 and have even^344 been granted more than I requested; for I hope as a prisoner in
Christ Jesus to salute you, if indeed it be the will of God that I be thought worthy of attaining

my lot without hindrance unto the end. For I am afraid of your love,^346 lest it should do me
an injury. For it is easy for you to accomplish what you please; but it is difficult for me to
attain to God, if ye spare me.

For it is not my desire to act towards you as a man-pleaser,^351 but as pleasing God, even
as also ye please Him. For neither shall I ever have such [another] opportunity of attaining
to God; nor will ye, if ye shall now be silent, ever be entitled to^352 the honour of a better
work. For if ye are silent concerning me, I shall become God’s; but if you show your love to
my flesh, I shall again have to run my race. Pray, then, do not seek to confer any greater favour
upon me than that I be sacrificed to God while the altar is still prepared; that, being gathered
together in love, ye may sing praise to the Father, through Christ Jesus, that God has deemed
me, the bishop of Syria, worthy to be sent for^353 from the east unto the west. It is good to
set from the world unto God, that I may rise again to Him.

Ye have never envied any one; ye have taught others. Now I desire that those things
may be confirmed [by your conduct], which in your instructions ye enjoin [on others]. Only
request in my behalf both inward and outward strength, that I may not only speak, but
[truly] will; and that I may not merely be called a Christian, but really be found to be one.
For if I be truly found [a Christian], I may also be called one, and be then deemed faithful,
when I shall no longer appear to the world. Nothing visible is eternal.^358 “For the things
which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.”^359 For our God,

I write to the Churches, and impress on them all, that I shall willingly die for God, unless
ye hinder me. I beseech of you not to show an unseasonable good-will towards me. Suffer
me to become food for the wild beasts, through whose instrumentality it will be granted me
to attain to God. I am the wheat of God, and let me be ground by the teeth of the wild beasts,
that I may be found the pure bread of Christ. Rather entice the wild beasts, that they may
become my tomb, and may leave nothing of my body; so that when I have fallen asleep [in
death], I may be no trouble to any one. Then shall I truly be a disciple of Christ, when the
world shall not see so much as my body. Entreat Christ for me, that by these instruments^366
I may be found a sacrifice [to God]. I do not, as Peter and Paul, issue commandments unto
you. They were apostles; I am but a condemned man: they were free,^367 while I am, even
until now, a servant. But when I suffer, I shall be the freed-man of Jesus, and shall rise again
emancipated in Him. And now, being a prisoner, I learn not to desire anything worldly or
vain.

From Syria even unto Rome I fight with beasts,^370 both by land and sea, both by night

benefits,^371 show themselves all the worse. But I am the more instructed by their injuries
[to act as a disciple of Christ]; “yet am I not thereby justified.”^372 May I enjoy the wild beasts
that are prepared for me; and I pray they may be found eager to rush upon me, which also
I will entice to devour me speedily, and not deal with me as with some, whom, out of fear,
they have not touched. But if they be unwilling to assail me, I will compel them to do so.


76


Pardon me [in this]: I know what is for my benefit. Now I begin to be a disciple. And let
no one, of things visible or invisible, envy^373 me that I should attain to Jesus Christ. Let fire
and the cross; let the crowds of wild beasts; let tearings,^374 breakings, and dislocations of
bones; let cutting off of members; let shatterings of the whole body; and let all the dreadful^375
torments of the devil come upon me: only let me attain to Jesus Christ.

All the pleasures of the world, and all the kingdoms of this earth,^380 shall profit me
nothing. It is better for me to die in behalf of^381 Jesus Christ, than to reign over all the ends
of the earth. “For what shall a man be profited, if he gain the whole world, but lose his own
soul?”^382 Him I seek, who died for us: Him I desire, who rose again for our sake. This is the
gain which is laid up for me. Pardon me, brethren: do not hinder me from living, do not
wish to keep me in a state of death;^383 and while I desire to belong to God, do not ye give
me over to the world. Suffer me to obtain pure light: when I have gone thither, I shall indeed
be a man of God. Permit me to be an imitator of the passion of my God. If any one has Him
within himself, let him consider what I desire, and let him have sympathy with me, as
knowing how I am straitened.

for us and rose again. Pardon me, brethren: do not hinder me in attaining to life; for Jesus
is the life of believers. Do not wish to keep me in a state of death,^385 for life without Christ
is death. While I desire to belong to God, do not ye give me over to the world. Suffer me to

The prince of this world would fain carry me away, and corrupt my disposition towards
God. Let none of you, therefore, who are [in Rome] help him; rather be ye on my side, that
is, on the side of God. Do not speak of Jesus Christ, and yet set your desires on the world.
Let not envy find a dwelling-place among you; nor even should I, when present with you,
exhort you to it, be ye persuaded to listen to me, but rather give credit to those things which
I now write to you. For though I am alive while I write to you, yet I am eager to die. My


77


love^386 has been crucified, and there is no fire in me desiring to be fed;^387 but there is
within me a water that liveth and speaketh,^388 saying to me inwardly, Come to the Father.
I have no delight in corruptible food, nor in the pleasures of this life. I desire the bread of
God, the heavenly bread, the bread of life, which is the flesh of Jesus Christ, the Son of God,
who became afterwards of the seed of David and Abraham; and I desire the drink of God,
namely His blood, which is incorruptible love and eternal life.

brief letter; do ye give credit to me. Jesus Christ will reveal these things to you, [so that ye
shall know] that I speak truly. He^391 is the mouth altogether free from falsehood, by which
the Father has truly spoken. Pray ye for me, that I may attain [the object of my desire]. I
have not written to you according to the flesh, but according to the will of God. If I shall
suffer, ye have wished [well] to me; but if I am rejected, ye have hated me.

who was delivered [to death] for my sake. “What shall I render to the Lord for all His benefits
towards me?”^393 Now God, even the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ, shall reveal these
things to you, [so that ye shall know] that I speak truly. And do ye pray along with me, that

Remember in your prayers the Church in Syria, which now has God for its shepherd,

for me, I am ashamed to be counted one of them; for indeed I am not worthy, as being the
very last of them, and one born out of due time.^394 But I have obtained mercy to be some-
body, if I shall attain to God. My spirit salutes you, and the love of the Churches that have
received me in the name of Jesus Christ, and not as a mere passer-by. For even those Churches
which were not^395 near to me in the way, I mean according to the flesh,^396 have gone before
me,^397 city by city, [to meet me.]
Remember in your prayers the Church which is in Syria, which, instead of me, has now

it, as well as your love towards Him. But as for me, I am ashamed to be counted one of them;
for I am not worthy, as being the very last of them, and one born out of due time. But I have

me.^398 As to those who have gone before me from Syria to Rome for the glory of God, I
believe that you are acquainted with them; to whom, [then,] do ye make known that I am
at hand. For they are all worthy, both of God and of you; and it is becoming that you should
refresh them in all things. I have written these things unto you, on the day before the ninth
of the Kalends of September (that^399 is, on the twenty-third day of August). Fare ye well to
the end, in the patience of Jesus Christ. Amen.

presbyters, and the deacons, who have been appointed by the will of God the Father, through
the Lord Jesus Christ, who, according to His own will, has firmly established His Church upon
a rock, by a spiritual building, not made with hands, against which the winds and the floods
have beaten, yet have not been able to overthrow it:^402 yea, and may spiritual wickedness
never be able to do so, but be thoroughly weakened by the power of Jesus Christ our Lord.

Epistle to the Philadelphians: Shorter and Longer Versions


### Chapter I.—Praise of the bishop.


Whichbishop,^403 I know, obtained the ministry which pertains to the common [weal],
not of himself, neither by men,^404 nor through vainglory, but by the love of God the Father,
and the Lord Jesus Christ; at whose meekness I am struck with admiration, and who by his
silence is able to accomplish more than those who vainly talk. For he is in harmony with
the commandments [of God], even as the harp is with its strings. Wherefore my soul declares
his mind towards God a happy one, knowing it to be virtuous and perfect, and that his sta-
bility as well as freedom from all anger is after the example of the infinite^405 meekness of
the living God.
Havingbeheld your bishop, I know that he was not selected to undertake the ministry
which pertains to the common [weal], either by himself or by men,^406 or out of vainglory,
but by the love of Jesus Christ, and of God the Father, who raised Him from the dead; at
whose meekness I am struck with admiration, and who by His silence is able to accomplish
more than they who talk a great deal. For he is in harmony with the commandments and
ordinances of the Lord, even as the strings are with the harp, and is no less blameless than
was Zacharias the priest.^407 Wherefore my soul declares his mind towards God a happy
one, knowing it to be virtuous and perfect, and that his stability as well as freedom from all
anger is after the example of the infinite meekness of the living God.

Wherefore, as children of light and truth, flee from division and wicked doctrines; but
where the shepherd is, there do ye as sheep follow. For there are many wolves that appear
worthy of credit, who, by means of a pernicious pleasure, carry captive^408 those that are
running towards God; but in your unity they shall have no place.
Wherefore, as children of light and truth, avoid the dividing of your unity, and the
wicked doctrine of the heretics, from whom “a defiling influence has gone forth into all the
earth.”^409 But where the shepherd is, there do ye as sheep follow. For there are many wolves
in sheep’s clothing,^410 who, by means of a pernicious pleasure, carry captive^411 those that

### Chapter III.—Avoid schismatics.


Keep yourselves from those evil plants which Jesus Christ does not tend, because they
are not the planting of the Father. Not that I have found any division among you, but ex-
ceeding purity. For as many as are of God and of Jesus Christ are also with the bishop. And
as many as shall, in the exercise of repentance, return into the unity of the Church, these,
too, shall belong to God, that they may live according to Jesus Christ. Do not err, my brethren.
If any man follows him that makes a schism in the Church, he shall not inherit the kingdom
of God. If any one walks according to a strange^412 opinion, he agrees not with the passion
[of Christ.].
Keep yourselves, then, from those evil plants which Jesus Christ does not tend, but that
wild beast, the destroyer of men, because they are not the planting of the Father, but the
seed of the wicked one. Not that I have found any division among you do I write these things;
but I arm you beforehand, as the children of God. For as many as are of Christ are also with
the bishop; but as many as fall away from him, and embrace communion with the accursed,
these shall be cut off along with them. For they are not Christ’s husbandry, but the seed of
the enemy, from whom may you ever be delivered by the prayers of the shepherd, that most
faithful and gentle shepherd who presides over you. I therefore exhort you in the Lord to
receive with all tenderness those that repent and return to the unity of the Church, that
through your kindness and forbearance they may recover^413 themselves out of the snare of
the devil, and becoming worthy of Jesus Christ, may obtain eternal salvation in the kingdom
of Christ. Brethren, be not deceived. If any man follows him that separates from the truth,
he shall not inherit the kingdom of God; and if any man does not stand aloof from the
preacher of falsehood, he shall be condemned to hell. For it is obligatory neither to separate
from the godly, nor to associate with the ungodly. If any one walks according to a strange^414
opinion, he is not of Christ, nor a partaker of His passion; but is a fox,^415 a destroyer of the
vineyard of Christ. Have no fellowship^416 with such a man, lest ye perish along with him,
even should he be thy father, thy son, thy brother, or a member of thy family. For says [the
Scripture], “Thine eye shall not spare him.”^417 You ought therefore to “hate those that hate
God, and to waste away [with grief] on account of His enemies.”^418 I do not mean that you
should beat them or persecute them, as do the Gentiles “that know not the Lord and God;”^419

but that you should regard them as your enemies, and separate yourselves from them, while
yet you admonish them, and exhort them to repentance, if it may be they will hear, if it may
be they will submit themselves. For our God is a lover of mankind, and “will have all men
to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth.”^420 Wherefore “He makes His sun
to rise upon the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust;”^421

### Chapter IV.—Have but one Eucharist, etc.


Take ye heed, then, to have but one Eucharist. For there is one flesh of our Lord Jesus
Christ, and one cup to [show forth^423 ] the unity of His blood; one altar; as there is one
bishop, along with the presbytery and deacons, my fellow-servants: that so, whatsoever ye
do, ye may do it according to [the will of] God.
I have confidence of you in the Lord, that ye will be of no other mind. Wherefore I write
boldly to your love, which is worthy of God, and exhort you to have but one faith, and one
[kind of] preaching, and one Eucharist. For there is one flesh of the Lord Jesus Christ; and
His blood which was shed for us is one; one loaf also is broken to all [the communicants],
and one cup is distributed among them all: there is but one altar for the whole Church, and
one bishop, with the presbytery and deacons, my fellow-servants. Since, also, there is but
one unbegotten Being, God, even the Father; and one only-begotten Son, God, the Word
and man; and one Comforter, the Spirit of truth; and also one preaching, and one faith, and
one baptism;^424 and one Church which the holy apostles established from one end of the
earth to the other by the blood of Christ, and by their own sweat and toil; it behoves you
also, therefore, as “a peculiar people, and a holy nation,”^425 to perform all things with har-
mony in Christ. Wives, be ye subject to your husbands in the fear of God;^426 and ye virgins,
to Christ in purity, not counting marriage an abomination, but desiring that which is better,
not for the reproach of wedlock, but for the sake of meditating on the law. Children, obey
your parents, and have an affection for them, as workers together with God for your birth
[into the world]. Servants, be subject to your masters in God, that ye may be the freed-men
of Christ.^427 Husbands, love your wives, as fellow-servants of God, as your own body, as
the partners of your life, and your co-adjutors in the procreation of children. Virgins, have
Christ alone before your eyes, and His Father in your prayers, being enlightened by the
Spirit. May I have pleasure in your purity, as that of Elijah, or as of Joshua the son of Nun,
as of Melchizedek, or as of Elisha, as of Jeremiah, or as of John the Baptist, as of the beloved
disciple, as of Timothy, as of Titus, as of Evodius, as of Clement, who departed this life in
[perfect] chastity,^428 Not, however, that I blame the other blessed [saints] because they
entered into the married state, of which I have just spoken.^429 For I pray that, being found

worthy of God, I may be found at their feet in the kingdom, as at the feet of Abraham, and
Isaac, and Jacob; as of Joseph, and Isaiah, and the rest of the prophets; as of Peter, and Paul,
and the rest of the apostles, that were married men. For they entered into these marriages
not for the sake of appetite, but out of regard for the propagation of mankind. Fathers,
“bring up your children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord;”^430 and teach them the
holy Scriptures, and also trades, that they may not indulge in idleness. Now [the Scripture]
says, “A righteous father educates [his children] well; his heart shall rejoice in a wise son.”^431
Masters, be gentle towards your servants, as holy Job has taught you;^432 for there is one
nature, and one family of mankind. For “in Christ there is neither bond nor free.”^433 Let
governors be obedient to Cæsar; soldiers to those that command them; deacons to the
presbyters, as to high-priests; the presbyters, and deacons, and the rest of the clergy, together
with all the people, and the soldiers, and the governors, and Cæsar [himself], to the bishop;
the bishop to Christ, even as Christ to the Father. And thus unity is preserved throughout.
Let not the widows be wanderers about, nor fond of dainties, nor gadders from house to
house; but let them be like Judith, noted for her seriousness; and like Anna, eminent for her
sobriety. I do not ordain these things as an apostle: for “who am I, or what is my father’s
house,”^434 that I should pretend to be equal in honour to them? But as your “fellow-sol-
dier,”^435 I hold the position of one who [simply] admonishes you.

My brethren, I am greatly enlarged in loving you; and rejoicing exceedingly [over you],
I seek to secure your safety. Yet it is not I, but Jesus Christ, for whose sake being bound I
fear the more, inasmuch as I am not yet perfect. But your prayer to God shall make me
perfect, that I may attain to that portion which through mercy has been allotted me, while
I flee to the Gospel as to the flesh of Jesus, and to the apostles as to the presbytery of the
Church. And let us also love the prophets, because they too have proclaimed the Gospel,^436
and placed their hope in Him,^437 and waited for Him; in whom also believing, they were
saved, through union to Jesus Christ, being holy men, worthy of love and admiration, having
had witness borne to them by Jesus Christ, and being reckoned along with [us] in the Gospel
of the common hope.
My brethren, I am greatly enlarged in loving you; and rejoicing exceedingly [over you],
I seek to secure your safety. Yet it is not I, but the Lord Jesus through me; for whose sake
being bound, I fear the more, for I am not yet perfect. But your prayer to God shall make
me perfect, that I may attain that to which I have been called, while I flee to the Gospel as
to the flesh of Jesus Christ, and to the apostles as the presbytery of the Church. I do also
love the prophets as those who announced Christ, and as being partakers of the same Spirit
with the apostles. For as the false prophets and the false apostles drew [to themselves] one
and the same wicked, deceitful, and seducing^438 spirit; so also did the prophets and the
apostles receive from God, through Jesus Christ, one and the same Holy Spirit, who is good,
and sovereign,^439 and true, and the Author of [saving] knowledge.^440 For there is one God
of the Old and New Testament, “one Mediator between God and men,” for the creation of
both intelligent and sensitive beings, and in order to exercise a beneficial and suitable
providence [over them]. There is also one Comforter, who displayed^441 His power in Moses,
and the prophets, and apostles. All the saints, therefore, were saved by Christ, hoping in
Him, and waiting for Him; and they obtained through Him salvation, being holy ones,
worthy of love and admiration, having testimony borne to them by Jesus Christ, in the
Gospel of our common hope.

### Chapter VI.—Do not accept Judaism.


But if any one preach the Jewish law^442 unto you, listen not to him. For it is better to
hearken to Christian doctrine from a man who has been circumcised, than to Judaism from
one uncircumcised. But if either of such persons do not speak concerning Jesus Christ, they
are in my judgment but as monuments and sepulchres of the dead, upon which are written


83


only the names of men. Flee therefore the wicked devices and snares of the prince of this
world, lest at any time being conquered^443 by his artifices,^444 ye grow weak in your love.
But be ye all joined together^445 with an undivided heart. And I thank my God that I have a
good conscience in respect to you, and that no one has it in his power to boast, either privately
or publicly, that I have burdened^446 any one either in much or in little. And I wish for all
among whom I have spoken, that they may not possess that for a testimony against them.
If any one preaches the one God of the law and the prophets, but denies Christ to be
the Son of God, he is a liar, even as also is his father the devil,^447 and is a Jew falsely so called,
being possessed of^448 mere carnal circumcision. If any one confesses Christ Jesus the Lord,
but denies the God of the law and of the prophets, saying that the Father of Christ is not the
Maker of heaven and earth, he has not continued in the truth any more than his father the
devil,^449 and is a disciple of Simon Magus, not of the Holy Spirit. If any one says there is
one God, and also confesses Christ Jesus, but thinks the Lord to be a mere man, and not the
only-begotten^450 God, and Wisdom, and the Word of God, and deems Him to consist
merely of a soul and body, such an one is a serpent, that preaches deceit and error for the
destruction of men. And such a man is poor in understanding, even as by name he is an
Ebionite.^451 If any one confesses the truths mentioned,^452 but calls lawful wedlock, and the
procreation of children, destruction and pollution, or deems certain kinds of food abomin-
able, such an one has the apostate dragon dwelling within him. If any one confesses the
Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost, and praises the creation, but calls the incarnation
merely an appearance, and is ashamed of the passion, such an one has denied the faith, not

less than the Jews who killed Christ. If any one confesses these things, and that God the
Word did dwell in a human body, being within it as the Word, even as the soul also is in
the body, because it was God that inhabited it, and not a human soul, but affirms that un-
lawful unions are a good thing, and places the highest happiness^453 in pleasure, as does the
man who is falsely called a Nicolaitan, this person can neither be a lover of God, nor a lover
of Christ, but is a corrupter of his own flesh, and therefore void of the Holy Spirit, and a
stranger to Christ. All such persons are but monuments and sepulchres of the dead, upon
which are written only the names of dead men. Flee, therefore, the wicked devices and snares
of the spirit which now worketh in the children of this world,^454 lest at any time being
overcome,^455 ye grow weak in your love. But be ye all joined together^456 with an undivided
heart and a willing mind, “being of one accord and of one judgment,”^457 being always of
the same opinion about the same things, both when you are at ease and in danger, both in
sorrow and in joy. I thank God, through Jesus Christ, that I have a good conscience in respect
to you, and that no one has it in his power to boast, either privately or publicly, that I have
burdened any one either in much or in little. And I wish for all among whom I have spoken,
that they may not possess that for a testimony against them.

For though some would have deceived me according to the flesh, yet the Spirit, as being
from God, is not deceived. For it knows both whence it comes and whither it goes,^458 and
detects the secrets [of the heart]. For, when I was among you, I cried, I spoke with a loud
voice: Give heed to the bishop, and to the presbytery and deacons. Now, some suspected
me of having spoken thus, as knowing beforehand the division caused by some among
you.^459 But He is my witness, for whose sake I am in bonds, that I got no intelligence from


84


any man.^460 But the Spirit proclaimed these words: Do nothing without the bishop; keep
your bodies^461 as the temples of God;^462 love unity; avoid divisions; be the followers of Jesus
Christ, even as He is of His Father.
For though some would have deceived me according to the flesh, yet my spirit is not
deceived; for I have received it from God. For it knows both whence it comes and whither

with a loud voice—the word is not mine, but God’s—Give heed to the bishop, and to the
presbytery and deacons. But if ye suspect that I spake thus, as having learned beforehand
the division caused by some among you, He is my witness, for whose sake I am in bonds,
that I learned nothing of it from the mouth of any man. But the Spirit made an announcement
to me, saying as follows: Do nothing without the bishop; keep your bodies^463 as the temples
of God; love unity; avoid divisions; be ye followers of Paul, and of the rest of the apostles,

I therefore did what belonged to me, as a man devoted to^464 unity. For where there is

if they turn in penitence to the unity of God, and to communion with the bishop.^465 I trust
[as to you] in the grace of Jesus Christ, who shall free you from every bond. And I exhort
you to do nothing out of strife, but according to the doctrine of Christ. When I heard some
saying, If I do not find it in the ancient^466 Scriptures, I will not believe the Gospel; on my
saying to them, It is written, they answered me, That remains to be proved. But to me Jesus
Christ is in the place of all that is ancient: His cross, and death, and resurrection, and the
faith^467 which is by Him, are undefiled monuments of antiquity; by which I desire, through
your prayers, to be justified.
I therefore did what belonged to me, as a man devoted to unity; adding this also, that
where there is diversity of judgment, and wrath, and hatred, God does not dwell. To all them
that repent, God grants forgiveness, if they with one consent return to the unity of Christ,
and communion with the bishop.^468 I trust to the grace of Jesus Christ, that He will free
you from every bond of wickedness.^469 I therefore exhort you that ye do nothing out of
strife,^470 but according to the doctrine of Christ. For I have heard some saying, If I do not
find the Gospel in the archives, I will not believe it. To such persons I say that my archives
are Jesus Christ, to disobey whom is manifest destruction. My authentic archives are His
cross, and death, and resurrection, and the faith which bears on these things, by which I
desire, through your prayers, to be justified. He who disbelieves the Gospel disbelieves
everything along with it. For the archives ought not to be preferred to the Spirit.^471 “It is
hard to kick against the pricks;”^472 it is hard to disbelieve Christ; it is hard to reject the
preaching of the apostles.

### Chapter IX.—The Old Testament is good: the New Testament is better.


The priests^473 indeed are good, but the High Priest is better; to whom the holy of holies
has been committed, and who alone has been trusted with the secrets of God. He is the door
of the Father, by which enter in Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the prophets, and the
apostles, and the Church. All these have for their object the attaining to the unity of God.
But the Gospel possesses something transcendent [above the former dispensation], viz., the
appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ, His passion and resurrection. For the beloved prophets
announced Him,^474 but the Gospel is the perfection of immortality.^475 All these things are
good together, if ye believe in love.
The priests^476 indeed, and the ministers of the word, are good; but the High Priest is
better, to whom the holy of holies has been committed, and who alone has been entrusted
with the secrets of God. The ministering powers of God are good. The Comforter is holy,
and the Word is holy, the Son of the Father, by whom He made all things, and exercises a
providence over them all. This is the Way^477 which leads to the Father, the Rock,^478 the
Defence,^479 the Key, the Shepherd,^480 the Sacrifice, the Door^481 of knowledge, through
which have entered Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, Moses and all the company of the
prophets, and these pillars of the world, the apostles, and the spouse of Christ, on whose
account He poured out His own blood, as her marriage portion, that He might redeem her.
All these things tend towards the unity of the one and only true God. But the Gospel possesses
something transcendent [above the former dispensation], viz. the appearing of our Saviour
Jesus Christ, His passion, and the resurrection itself. For those things which the prophets
announced, saying, “Until He come for whom it is reserved, and He shall be the expectation
of the Gentiles,”^482 have been fulfilled in the Gospel, [our Lord saying,] “Go ye and teach
all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghost.”^483 All then are good together, the law, the prophets, the apostles, the whole company
[of others] that have believed through them: only if we love one another.

do this, for the sake^484 of God; as also the nearest Churches have sent, in some cases bishops,

receive you. But may those that dishonoured them be forgiven through the grace of Jesus
Christ, “who wisheth not the death of the sinner, but his repentance.”^489 The love of the
brethren at Troas salutes you; whence also I write to you by Burrhus,^490 who was sent along
with me by the Ephesians and Smyrnæans, to show their respect:^491 whom the Lord Jesus
Christ will requite, in whom they hope, in flesh, and soul, and spirit, and faith, and love,

I GlorifyGod, even Jesus Christ, who has given you such wisdom. For I have observed
that ye are perfected in an immoveable faith, as if ye were nailed to the cross of our Lord
Jesus Christ, both in the flesh and in the spirit, and are established in love through the blood
of Christ, being fully persuaded with respect to our Lord, that He was truly of the seed of
David according to the flesh,^494 and the Son of God according to the will and power^495 of
God; that He was truly born of a virgin, was baptized by John, in order that all righteousness
might be fulfilled^496 by Him; and was truly, under Pontius Pilate and Herod the tetrarch,
nailed [to the cross] for us in His flesh. Of this fruit^497 we are by His divinely-blessed passion,
that He might set up a standard^498 for all ages, through His resurrection, to all His holy and
faithful [followers], whether among Jews or Gentiles, in the one body of His Church.
I Glorifythe God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who by Him has given you such
wisdom. For I have observed that ye are perfected in an immoveable faith, as if ye were
nailed to the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, both in the flesh and in the spirit, and are estab-
lished in love through the blood of Christ, being fully persuaded, in very truth, with respect
to our Lord Jesus Christ, that He was the Son of God, “the first-born of every creature,”^499
God the Word, the only-begotten Son, and was of the seed of David according to the flesh,^500
by the Virgin Mary; was baptized by John, that all righteousness might be fulfilled^501 by
Him; that He lived a life of holiness without sin, and was truly, under Pontius Pilate and
Herod the tetrarch, nailed [to the cross] for us in His flesh. From whom we also derive our
being,^502 from His divinely-blessed passion, that He might set up a standard for the ages,
through His resurrection, to all His holy and faithful [followers], whether among Jews or
Gentiles, in the one body of His Church.

### Chapter II.—Christ’s true passion.


Now, He suffered all these things for our sakes, that we might be saved. And He suffered
truly, even as also He truly raised up Himself, not, as certain unbelievers maintain, that He
only seemed to suffer, as they themselves only seem to be [Christians]. And as they believe,
so shall it happen unto them, when they shall be divested of their bodies, and be mere evil
spirits.^503
Now, He suffered all these things for us; and He suffered them really, and not in appear-
ance only, even as also He truly rose again. But not, as some of the unbelievers, who are
ashamed of the formation of man, and the cross, and death itself, affirm, that in appearance
only, and not in truth, He took a body of the Virgin, and suffered only in appearance, for-
getting, as they do, Him who said, “The Word was made flesh;”^504 and again, “Destroy this
temple, and in three days I will raise it up;”^505 and once more, “If I be lifted up from the
earth, I will draw all men unto Me.”^506 The Word therefore did dwell in flesh, for “Wisdom
built herself an house.”^507 The Word raised up again His own temple on the third day, when
it had been destroyed by the Jews fighting against Christ. The Word, when His flesh was
lifted up, after the manner of the brazen serpent in the wilderness, drew all men to Himself
for their eternal salvation.^508

### Chapter III.—Christ was possessed of a body after His resurrection.


For I know that after His resurrection also He was still possessed of flesh,^509 and I believe
that He is so now. When, for instance, He came to those who were with Peter, He said to
them, “Lay hold, handle Me, and see that I am not an incorporeal spirit.”^510 And immediately
they touched Him, and believed, being convinced both by His flesh and spirit. For this cause
also they despised death, and were found its conquerors.^511 And after his resurrection He
did eat and drink with them, as being possessed of flesh, although spiritually He was united
to the Father.
And I know that He was possessed of a body not only in His being born and crucified,
but I also know that He was so after His resurrection, and believe that He is so now. When,
for instance, He came to those who were with Peter, He said to them, “Lay hold, handle Me,
and see that I am not an incorporeal spirit.”^512 “For a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye
see Me have.”^513 And He says to Thomas, “Reach hither thy finger into the print of the nails,
and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into My side;”^514 and immediately they believed
that He was Christ. Wherefore Thomas also says to Him, “My Lord, and my God.”^515 And
on this account also did they despise death, for it were too little to say, indignities and stripes.
Nor was this all; but also after He had shown Himself to them, that He had risen indeed,
and not in appearance only, He both ate and drank with them during forty entire days. And
thus was He, with the flesh, received up in their sight unto Him that sent Him, being with
that same flesh to come again, accompanied by glory and power. For, say the [holy] oracles,
“This same Jesus, who is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come, in like manner as
ye have seen Him go unto heaven.”^516 But if they say that He will come at the end of the
world without a body, how shall those “see Him that pierced Him,”^517 and when they recog-
nise Him, “mourn for themselves?”^518 For incorporeal beings have neither form nor figure,
nor the aspect^519 of an animal possessed of shape, because their nature is in itself simple.

### Chapter IV.—Beware of these heretics.


I give you these instructions, beloved, assured that ye also hold the same opinions [as


88


I do]. But I guard you beforehand from those beasts in the shape of men, whom you must
not only not receive, but, if it be possible, not even meet with; only you must pray to God
for them, if by any means they may be brought to repentance, which, however, will be very
difficult. Yet Jesus Christ, who is our true life, has the power of [effecting] this. But if these
things were done by our Lord only in appearance, then am I also only in appearance bound.
And why have I also surrendered myself to death, to fire, to the sword, to the wild beasts?
But, [in fact,] he who is near to the sword is near to God; he that is among the wild beasts
is in company with God; provided only he be so in the name of Jesus Christ. I undergo all
these things that I may suffer together with Him,^520 He who became a perfect man inwardly
strengthening me.^521

means they may be brought to repentance. For if the Lord were in the body in appearance
only, and were crucified in appearance only, then am I also bound in appearance only. And
why have I also surrendered myself to death, to fire, to the sword, to the wild beasts? But,
[in fact,] I endure all things for Christ, not in appearance only, but in reality, that I may
suffer together with Him, while He Himself inwardly strengthens me; for of myself I have
no such ability.

the law of Moses, nor the Gospel even to this day, nor the sufferings we have individually
endured. For they think also the same thing regarding us.^523 For what does any one profit
me, if he commends me, but blasphemes my Lord, not confessing that He was [truly] pos-
sessed of a body?^524 But he who does not acknowledge this, has in fact altogether denied
Him, being enveloped in death.^525 I have not, however, thought good to write the names
of such persons, inasmuch as they are unbelievers. Yea, far be it from me to make any
mention of them, until they repent and return to [a true belief in] Christ’s passion, which
is our resurrection.

### Chapter VI—Unbelievers in the blood of Christ shall be condemned.


Let no man deceive himself. Both the things which are in heaven, and the glorious an-
gels,^527 and rulers, both visible and invisible, if they believe not in the blood of Christ, shall,


89


in consequence, incur condemnation.^528 “He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.”^529
Let not [high] place puff any one up: for that which is worth all is^530 faith and love, to which
nothing is to be preferred. But consider those who are of a different opinion with respect
to the grace of Christ which has come unto us, how opposed they are to the will of God.
They have no regard for love; no care for the widow, or the orphan, or the oppressed; of the
bond, or of the free; of the hungry, or of the thirsty.
Let no man deceive himself. Unless he believes that Christ Jesus has lived in the flesh,
and shall confess His cross and passion, and the blood which He shed for the salvation of
the world, he shall not obtain eternal life, whether he be a king, or a priest, or a ruler, or a
private person, a master or a servant, a man or a woman. “He that is able to receive it, let
him receive it.”^531 Let no man’s place, or dignity, or riches, puff him up; and let no man’s
low condition or poverty abase him. For the chief points are faith towards God, hope towards
Christ, the enjoyment of those good things for which we look, and love towards God and
our neighbour. For, “Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and thy neighbour
as thyself.”^532 And the Lord says, “This is life eternal, to know the only true God, and Jesus
Christ whom He has sent.”^533 And again, “A new commandment give I unto you, that ye
love one another. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.”^534 Do
ye, therefore, notice those who preach other doctrines, how they affirm that the Father of
Christ cannot be known, and how they exhibit enmity and deceit in their dealings with one
another. They have no regard for love; they despise the good things we expect hereafter;
they regard present things as if they were durable; they ridicule him that is in affliction; they
laugh at him that is in bonds.

### Chapter VII.—Let us stand aloof from such heretics.


They abstain from the Eucharist and from prayer,^535 because they confess not the
Eucharist to be the flesh of our Saviour Jesus Christ, which suffered for our sins, and which
the Father, of His goodness, raised up again. Those, therefore, who speak against this gift
of God, incur death^536 in the midst of their disputes. But it were better for them to treat it
with respect,^537 that they also might rise again. It is fitting, therefore, that ye should keep
aloof from such persons, and not to speak of^538 them either in private or in public, but to
give heed to the prophets, and above all, to the Gospel, in which the passion [of Christ] has
been revealed to us, and the resurrection has been fully proved.^539 But avoid all divisions,
as the beginning of evils.
They are ashamed of the cross; they mock at the passion; they make a jest of the resur-
rection. They are the offspring of that spirit who is the author of all evil, who led Adam,^540
by means of his wife, to transgress the commandment, who slew Abel by the hands of Cain,
who fought against Job, who was the accuser of Joshua^541 the son of Josedech, who sought
to “sift the faith”^542 of the apostles, who stirred up the multitude of the Jews against the
Lord, who also now “worketh in the children of disobedience;^543 from whom the Lord Jesus
Christ will deliver us, who prayed that the faith of the apostles might not fail,^544 not because
He was not able of Himself to preserve it, but because He rejoiced in the pre-eminence of
the Father. It is fitting, therefore, that ye should keep aloof from such persons, and neither
in private nor in public to talk with^545 them; but to give heed to the law, and the prophets,
and to those who have preached to you the word of salvation. But flee from all abominable
heresies, and those that cause schisms, as the beginning of evils.

has entrusted it. Wherever the bishop shall appear, there let the multitude [of the people]
also be; even as, wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church. It is not lawful without
the bishop either to baptize or to celebrate a love-feast; but whatsoever he shall approve of,
that is also pleasing to God, so that everything that is done may be secure and valid.^548

### Chapter IX.—Honour the bishop.


Moreover,^551 it is in accordance with reason that we should return to soberness [of
conduct], and, while yet we have opportunity, exercise repentance towards God. It is well
to reverence^552 both God and the bishop. He who honours the bishop has been honoured
by God; he who does anything without the knowledge of the bishop, does [in reality] serve
the devil. Let all things, then, abound to you through grace, for ye are worthy. Ye have re-
freshed me in all things, and Jesus Christ [shall refresh] you. Ye have loved me when absent
as well as when present. May God recompense you, for whose sake, while ye endure all
things, ye shall attain unto Him.
Moreover, it is in accordance with reason that we should return to soberness [of conduct],
and, while yet we have opportunity, exercise repentance towards God. For “in Hades there
is no one who can confess his sins.”^553 For “behold the man, and his work is before him.”^554
And [the Scripture saith], “My son, honour thou God and the king.”^555 And say I, Honour
thou God indeed, as the Author and Lord of all things, but the bishop as the high-priest,
who bears the image of God—of God, inasmuch as he is a ruler, and of Christ, in his capacity
of a priest. After Him, we must also honour the king. For there is no one superior to God,
or even like to Him, among all the beings that exist. Nor is there any one in the Church
greater than the bishop, who ministers as a priest to God for the salvation of the whole
world. Nor, again, is there any one among rulers to be compared with the king, who secures
peace and good order to those over whom he rules. He who honours the bishop shall be
honoured by God, even as he that dishonours him shall be punished by God. For if he that
rises up against kings is justly held worthy of punishment, inasmuch as he dissolves public
order, of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy,^556 who
presumes to do anything without the bishop, thus both destroying the [Church’s] unity,
and throwing its order into confusion? For the priesthood is the very highest point of all
good things among men, against which whosoever is mad enough to strive, dishonours not
man, but God, and Christ Jesus, the First-born, and the only High Priest, by nature, of the
Father. Let all things therefore be done by you with good order in Christ. Let the laity be
subject to the deacons; the deacons to the presbyters; the presbyters to the bishop; the
bishop to Christ, even as He is to the Father. As ye, brethren, have refreshed me, so will Jesus
Christ refresh you. Ye have loved me when absent, as well as when present. God will recom-

Havingobtained good proof that thy mind is fixed in God as upon an immoveable rock,
I loudly glorify [His name] that I have been thought worthy [to behold] thy blameless face,^582
which may I ever enjoy in God! I entreat thee, by the grace with which thou art clothed, to
press forward in thy course, and to exhort all that they may be saved. Maintain thy position
with all care, both in the flesh and spirit. Have a regard to preserve unity, than which nothing
is better. Bear with all, even as the Lord does with thee. Support^583 all in love, as also thou
doest. Give thyself to prayer without ceasing.^584 Implore additional understanding to what
thou already hast. Be watchful, possessing a sleepless spirit. Speak to every man separately,
as God enables thee.^585 Bear the infirmities of all, as being a perfect athlete [in the Christian
life]: where the labour is great, the gain is all the more.

of both flesh and spirit, that thou mayest deal tenderly^593 with those [evils] that present
themselves visibly before thee. And as respects those that are not seen,^594 pray that [God]
would reveal them unto thee, in order that thou mayest be wanting in nothing, but mayest
abound in every gift. The times call for thee, as pilots do for the winds, and as one tossed
with tempest seeks for the haven, so that both thou [and those under thy care] may attain
to God. Be sober as an athlete of God: the prize set before thee is immortality and eternal
life, of which thou art also persuaded. In all things may my soul be for thine,^595 and my
bonds also, which thou hast loved.

## Introductory Note to the Syriac Version of the Ignatian Epistles


Whenthe Syriac version of the Ignatian Epistles was introduced to the English world
in 1845, by Mr. Cureton, the greatest satisfaction was expressed by many, who thought the
inveterate controversy about to be settled. Lord Russell made the learned divine a canon of
Westminster Abbey, and the critical Chevalier Bunsen^649 committed himself as its patron.
To the credit of the learned, in general, the work was gratefully received, and studied with
scientific conscientiousness by Lightfoot and others. The literature of this period is valuable;
and the result is decisive as to the Curetonian versions at least, which are fragmentary and
abridged, and yet they are a valuable contribution to the study of the whole case.
The following is the original Introductory Notice:—
Someaccount of the discovery of the Syriac version of the Ignatian Epistles has been
already given. We have simply to add here a brief description of the mss. from which the
Syriac text has been printed. That which is named αby Cureton, contains only the Epistle
to Polycarp, and exhibits the text of that Epistle which, after him, we have followed. He fixes
its age somewhere in the first half of the sixth century, or before the year 550. The second
ms., which Cureton refers to as β, is assigned by him to the seventh or eighth century. It
contains the three Epistles of Ignatius, and furnishes the text here followed in the Epistles
to the Ephesians and Romans. The third ms., which Cureton quotes as γ, has no date, but,
as he tells us, “belonged to the collection acquired by Moses of Nisibis in a.d. 931, and was
written apparently about three or four centuries earlier.” It contains the three Epistles to
Polycarp, the Ephesians, and the Romans. The text of all these mss. is in several passages
manifestly corrupt, and the translators appear at times to have mistaken the meaning of the
Greek original.
[N.B.—Bunsen is forced to allow the fact that the discovery of the lost work of Hippolytus
“throws new light on an obscure point of the Ignatian controversy,” i.e., the Sigein the
Epistle to the Magnesians (cap. viii.); but his treatment of the matter is unworthy of a candid
scholar.]

### The Epistle of Ignatius to Polycarp^650


Ignatius, who is [also called] Theophorus, to Polycarp, bishop of Smyrna, or rather, who
has as his own bishop God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ: [wishes] abundance of
happiness.


650 The inscription varies in each of the three Syriac mss., being in the first, “The Epistle of my lord Ignatius,
the bishop;” in the second, “The Epistle of Ignatius;” and in the third, “The Epistle of Ignatius, bishop of Antioch.”

## Epistle to Polycarp: Syriac Version


Epistle to Polycarp: Syriac Version


### Chapter I.


Becausethy mind is acceptable to me, inasmuch as it is established in God, as on a rock
which is immoveable, I glorify God the more exceedingly that I have been counted worthy
of [seeing] thy face, which I longed after in God. Now I beseech thee, by the grace with
which thou art clothed, to add [speed] to thy course, and that thou ever pray for all men
that they may be saved, and that thou demand^651 things which are befitting, with all assiduity
both of the flesh and spirit. Be studious of unity, than which nothing is more precious. Bear
with all men, even as our Lord beareth with thee. Show patience^652 with all men in love, as
[indeed] thou doest. Be stedfast in prayer. Ask for more understanding than that which
thou [already] hast. Be watchful, as possessing a spirit which sleepeth not. Speak with every
man according to the will of God. Bear the infirmities of all men as a perfect athlete; for
where the labour is great, the gain is also great.


651 For “vindicate thy place” in the Greek.
652 Literally, “draw out thy spirit.”

#### Chapter I.


Chapter I.


### Chapter II.


If thou lovest the good disciples only, thou hast no grace; [but] rather subdue those that
are evil by gentleness. All [sorts of] wounds are not healed by the same medicine. Mitigate
[the pain of] cutting^653 by tenderness. Be wise as the serpent in everything, and innocent,
with respect to those things which are requisite, even as the dove. For this reason thou art
[composed] of both flesh and spirit, that thou mayest entice^654 those things which are visible
before thy face, and mayest ask, as to those which are concealed from thee, that they [too]
may be revealed to thee, in order that thou be deficient in nothing, and mayest abound in
all gifts. The time demands, even as a pilot does a ship, and as one who stands exposed to
the tempest does a haven, that thou shouldst be worthy of God. Be thou watchful as an
athlete of God. That which is promised to us is life eternal, which cannot be corrupted, of
which things thou art also persuaded. In everything I will be instead^655 of thy soul, and my
bonds which thou hast loved.


653 Cureton observes, as one alternative here, that “the Syrian translator seems to have read παράξυσμαfor
παροξυσμούς.”
654 Or, “flatter,” probably meaning to “deal gently with.”
655 Thus the Syriac renders ἀντίψυχονin the Greek.

#### Chapter II.

### Chapter III.


Let not those who seem to be somewhat, and teach strange doctrines, strike thee with
apprehension; but stand thou in the truth, as an athlete^656 who is smitten, for it is [the part]
of a great athlete to be smitten, and [yet] conquer. More especially is it fitting that we should
bear everything for the sake of God, that He also may bear us. Be [still] more diligent than
thou yet art. Be discerning of the times. Look for Him that is above the times, Him who has
no times, Him who is invisible, Him who for our sakes became visible, Him who is impalp-
able, Him who is impassible, Him who for our sakes suffered, Him who endured everything
in every form for our sakes.


656 The Greek has ἄκμων, “an anvil.”

#### Chapter III.

### Chapter IV.


Let not the widows be overlooked; on account of^657 our Lord be thou their guardian,
and let nothing be done without thy will; also do thou nothing without the will of God, as
indeed thou doest not. Stand rightly. Let there be frequent^658 assemblies: ask every man [to
them] by his name. Despise not slaves, either male or female; but neither let them be con-


100


temptuous, but let them labour the more as for the glory of God, that they may be counted
worthy of a more precious freedom, which is of God. Let them not desire to be set free out
of the common [fund], lest they be found the slaves of lust.

658 Or, “constant,” “regular.”

### Chapter V.


Flee wicked arts; but all the more discourse regarding them. Speak to my sisters, that
they love in our Lord, and that their husbands be sufficient for them in the flesh and spirit.
Then, again, charge my brethren in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that they love their
wives, as our Lord His Church. If any man is able in power to continue in purity,^659 to the
honour of the flesh of our Lord, let him continue so without boasting; if he boasts, he is
undone; if he become known apart from the bishop, he has destroyed himself.^660 It is be-
coming, therefore, to men and women who marry, that they marry with the counsel of the
bishop, that the marriage may be in our Lord, and not in lust. Let everything, therefore, be
[done] for the honour of God.

660 Or, “corrupted himself.”

### Chapter VI.


Look ye to the bishop, that God also may look upon you. I will be instead of the souls
of those who are subject to the bishop, and the presbyters, and the deacons; with them may
I have a portion in the presence of God! Labour together with one another, act as athletes^661
together, run together, suffer together, sleep together, rise together. As stewards of God,
and of His household,^662 and His servants, please Him and serve Him, that ye may receive
from Him the wages [promised]. Let none of you be rebellious. Let your baptism be to you
as armour, and faith as a spear, and love as a helmet, and patience as a panoply. Let your
treasures be your good works, that ye may receive the gift of God, as is just. Let your spirit
be long-suffering towards each other with meekness, even as God [is] toward you. As for
me, I rejoice in you at all times.

### The Second Epistle of Ignatius to the Ephesians^665


Ignatius, who is [also called] Theophorus, to the Church which is blessed in the greatness
of God the Father, and perfected; to her who was selected^666 from eternity, that she might be
at all times for glory, which abideth, and is unchangeable, and is perfected and chosen in the
purpose of truth by the will of the Father of Jesus Christ our God; to her who is worthy of
happiness; to her who is at Ephesus, in Jesus Christ, in joy which is unblameable: [wishes]
abundance of happiness.


665 Another inscription is, “Epistle the Second, which is to the Ephesians.”
666 Literally, “separated.”

### Chapter I.


Inasmuchas your name, which is greatly beloved, is acceptable to me in God, [your
name] which ye have acquired by nature, through a right and just will, and also by the faith
and love of Jesus Christ our Saviour, and ye are imitators of God, and are fervent in the
blood of God, and have speedily completed a work congenial to you; [for] when ye heard
that I was bound,^667 so as to be able to do nothing for the sake of the common name and
hope (and I hope, through your prayers, that I may be devoured by beasts at Rome, so that
by means of this of which I have been accounted worthy, I may be endowed with strength
to be a disciple of God), ye were diligent to come and see me. Seeing, then, that we have
become acquainted with your multitude^668 in the name of God, by Onesimus, who is your
bishop, in love which is unutterable, whom I pray that ye love in Jesus Christ our Lord, and
that all of you imitate his example,^669 for blessed is He who has given you such a bishop,
even as ye deserve [to have].^670


667 Literally, “bound from actions.”
668 Cureton renders, “have received your abundance,” probably referring the words to gifts sent by the

For, so long as there is not implanted in you any one lust which is able to torment you,

spiritual things, nor those that are spiritual carnal things; in like manner as neither can faith
[do] those things which are foreign to faith, nor want of faith [do] what belongs to faith.
For those things which ye have done in the flesh, even these are spiritual, because ye have
done everything in Jesus Christ.


672 Chaps. iv. v. vi. vii. of the Greek are totally omitted in the Syriac.

There was concealed from the ruler of this world the virginity of Mary and the birth of

all bonds were loosed; and the ancient kingdom and the error of evil was destroyed.
Henceforward all things were moved together, and the destruction of death was devised,
and there was the commencement of that which was perfected in God.^678


677 Literally, “the mysteries of the shout.” The meaning is here confused and obscure. See the Greek.
678 Chaps. xx. and xxi. of the Greek are altogether wanting in the Syriac. [N.B.—See spurious Epistle to
Philippians, cap. 4, infra. This concealment from Satan of the mystery of the incarnation is the explanation, ac-
cording to the Fathers, of his tempting the Messiah, and prompting His crucifixion. Also, Christ the more pro-
foundly humbled himself, “ne subtilis ille diaboli oculus magnum hoc pietatis deprehenderet sacramentum” (St.
Bernard, opp. ii. 1944). Bernard also uses this opinion very strikingly (opp. ii. 1953) in one of his sermons,
supposing that Satan discovered the secret too late for his own purpose, and then prompted the outcry, Come
down from the cross, to defeat the triumph of the second Adam. (Comp. St. Mark i. 24 and St. Luke iv. 34, where,
after the first defeat of the tempter, this demon suspects the second Adam, and tries to extort the secret).]

Fromof old have I prayed to God, that I might be counted worthy to behold your faces
which are worthy of God: now, therefore, being bound in Jesus Christ, I hope to meet you
and salute you, if it be the will [of God] that I should be accounted worthy to the end. For
the beginning is well arranged, if I be counted worthy to attain to the end, that I may receive
my portion, without hindrance, through suffering. For I am in fear of your love, lest it should
injure me. As to you, indeed, it is easy for you to do whatsoever ye wish; but as to me, it is
difficult for me to be accounted worthy of God, if indeed ye spare me not.

#### Chapter I.

### Chapter II.


For there is no other time such as this, that I should be accounted worthy of God; neither
will ye, if ye be silent, [ever] be found in a better work than this. If ye let me alone, I shall
be the word of God; but if ye love my flesh, again am I [only] to myself a voice. Ye cannot
give me anything more precious than this, that I should be sacrificed to God, while the altar
is ready; that ye may be in one concord in love, and may praise God the Father through Jesus
Christ our Lord, because He has deemed a bishop worthy to be God’s, having called him
from the east to the west. It is good that I should set from the world in God, that I may rise
in Him to life.^680

Ye have never envied any man. Ye have taught others. Only pray ye for strength to be
given to me from within and from without, that I may not only speak, but also may be
willing, and that I may not merely be called a Christian, but also may be found to be [one];
for if I am found to be [so], I may then also be called [so]. Then [indeed] shall I be faithful,
when I am no longer seen in the world. For there is nothing visible that is good. The work
is not [a matter^681 ] of persuasion; but Christianity is great when the world hateth it.

I write to all the Churches, and declare to all men, that I willingly die for the sake of

love which is unseasonable. Leave me to become [the prey of] the beasts, that by their means
I may be accounted worthy of God. I am the wheat of God, and by the teeth of the beasts I
shall be ground,^682 that I may be found the pure bread of God. Provoke ye greatly^683 the
wild beasts, that they may be for me a grave, and may leave nothing of my body, in order
that, when I have fallen asleep, I may not be a burden upon any one. Then shall I be in truth
a disciple of Jesus Christ, when the world seeth not even my body. Entreat of our Lord in
my behalf, that through these instruments I may be found a sacrifice to God. I do not, like
Peter and Paul, issue orders unto you. They are^684 apostles, but I am one condemned; they
indeed are free, but I am a slave, even until now. But if I suffer, I shall be the freed-man of
Jesus Christ, and I shall rise in Him from the dead, free. And now being in bonds, I learn
to desire nothing.

From Syria, and even unto Rome, I am cast among wild beasts, by sea and by land, by
night and by day, being bound between ten leopards, which are the band of soldiers, who,
even when I do good to them, all the more do evil unto me. I, however, am the rather in-
structed by their injurious treatment;^685 but not on this account am I justified to myself. I
rejoice in the beasts which are prepared for me, and I pray that they may in haste be found
for me; and I will provoke them speedily to devour me, and not be as those which are afraid
of some other men,^686 and will not approach them: even should they not be willing to ap-
proach me, I will go with violence against them. Know me from myself what is expedient
for me.^687 Let no one^688 envy me of those things which are seen and which are not seen,
that I should be accounted worthy of Jesus Christ. Fire, and the cross, and the beasts that
are prepared, cutting off of the limbs, and scattering of the bones, and crushing of the whole
body, harsh torments of the devil—let these come upon me, but^689 only let me be accounted
worthy of Jesus Christ.


685 Literally, “by their injury.”
686 Literally, “and not as that which is afraid of some other men.” So Cureton translates, but remarks that
the passage is evidently corrupt. The reference plainly is to the fact that the beasts sometimes refused to attack
their intended victims. See the case of Blandina, as reported by Eusebius (Hist. Eccl., v. 1.).
687 Cureton renders interrogatively, “What is expedient for me?” and remarks that “the meaning of the Syr-
iac appears to be, ‘I crave your indulgence to leave the knowledge of what is expedient for me to my own con-
science.’ ”
688 Literally, “nothing.”

My spirit saluteth you, and the love of the Churches which received me as the name of

(^692) [Now therefore, being about to arrive shortly in Rome, I know many things in God;
but I keep myself within measure, that I may not perish through boasting: for now it is
needful for me to fear the more, and not pay regard to those who puff me up. For they who
say such things to me scourge me; for I desire to suffer, but I do not know if I am worthy.
For zeal is not visible to many, but with me it has war. I have need, therefore, of meekness,
by which the prince of this world is destroyed. I am able to write to you of heavenly things,
but I fear lest I should do you an injury. Know me from myself. For I am cautious lest ye
should not be able to receive [such knowledge], and should be perplexed. For even I, not
because I am in bonds, and am able to know heavenly things, and the places of angels, and
the stations of the powers that are seen and that are not seen, am on this account a disciple;
for I am far short of the perfection which is worthy of God.] Be ye perfectly strong^693 in the
patience of Jesus Christ our God.
Here end the three Epistles of Ignatius, bishop and martyr.^694
691 Chap. viii. of the Greek is entirely omitted in the Syriac.
692 The following passage is not found in this Epistle in the Greek recensions, but forms, in substance, chaps.
iv. and v. of the Epistle to the Trallians. Diverse views are held by critics as to its proper place, according to the
degree of authority they ascribe to the Syriac version. Cureton maintains that this passage has been transferred
by the forger of the Epistle to the Trallians, "to give a fiar colour to the fabrication by introducing a part of the
genuine writing of Ignatius; while Hefele asserts that it is bound by the “closest connection” to the preceding
chapter in the Epistle to the Trallians.
693 Or, as in the Greek, “Fare ye well, to the end.”
694 [N.B.—The aphoristic genius of Ignatius seems to be felt by his Syrian abbreviator, who reduces whole
chapters to mere maxims.]

## Introductory Note to the Spurious Epistles of Ignatius


To the following introductory note of the translators nothing need be prefixed, except
a grateful acknowledgment of the value of their labours and of their good judgment in giving
us even these spurious writings for purposes of comparison. They have thus placed the
materials for a complete understanding of the whole subject, before students who have a
mind to subject it to a thorough and candid examination.
The following is the original Introductory Notice:—
We formerly stated that eight out of the fifteen Epistles bearing the name of Ignatius
are now universally admitted to be spurious. None of them are quoted or referred to by any
ancient writer previous to the sixth century. The style, moreover, in which they are written,
so different from that of the other Ignatian letters, and allusions which they contain to her-
esies and ecclesiastical arrangements of a much later date than that of their professed author,
render it perfectly certain that they are not the authentic production of the illustrious bishop
of Antioch.
We cannot tell when or by whom these Epistles were fabricated. They have been thought
to betray the same hand as the longer and interpolated form of the seven Epistles which are
generally regarded as genuine. And some have conceived that the writer who gave forth to
the world the Apostolic Constitutions under the name of Clement, was probably the author
of these letters falsely ascribed to Ignatius, as well as of the longer recension of the seven
Epistles which are mentioned by Eusebius.
It was a considerable time before editors in modern times began to discriminate between
the true and the false in the writings attributed to Ignatius. The letters first published under
his name were those three which exist only in Latin. These came forth in 1495 at Paris, being
appended to a life of Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury. Some three years later, eleven
Epistles, comprising those mentioned by Eusebius, and four others, were published in Latin,
and passed through four or five editions. In 1536, the whole of the professedly Ignatian letters
were published at Cologne in a Latin version; and this collection also passed through several
editions. It was not till 1557 that the Ignatian Epistles appeared for the first time in Greek
at Dillingen. After this date many editions came forth, in which the probably genuine were
still mixed up with the certainly spurious, the three Latin letters, only being rejected as
destitute of authority. Vedelius of Geneva first made the distinction which is now universally
accepted, in an edition of these Epistles which he published in 1623; and he was followed
by Archbishop Usher and others, who entered more fully into that critical examination of
these writings which has been continued down even to our own day.

#### Introductory Note to the Spurious Epistles of Ignatius


Introductory Note to the Spurious Epistles of Ignatius



The reader will have no difficulty in detecting the internal grounds on which these eight


106

letters are set aside as spurious. The difference of style from the other Ignatian writings will
strike him even in perusing the English version which we have given, while it is of course
much more marked in the original. And other decisive proofs present themselves in every
one of the Epistles. In that to the Tarsians there is found a plain allusion to the Sabellian
heresy, which did not arise till after the middle of the third century. In the Epistle to the
Antiochians there is an enumeration of various Church officers, who were certainly unknown
at the period when Ignatius lived. The Epistle to Hero plainly alludes to Manichæan errors,
and could not therefore have been written before the third century. There are equally decisive
proofs of spuriousness to be found in the Epistle to the Philippians, such as the references
it contains to the Patripassian heresy originated by Praxeas in the latter part of the second
century, and the ecclesiastical feasts, etc., of which it makes mention. The letter to Maria
Cassobolita is of a very peculiar style, utterly alien from that of the other Epistles ascribed
to Ignatius. And it is sufficient simply to glance at the short Epistles to St. John and the
Virgin Mary, in order to see that they carry the stamp of imposture on their front; and, in-
deed, no sooner were they published than by almost universal consent they were rejected.
But though the additional Ignatian letters here given are confessedly spurious, we have
thought it not improper to present them to the English reader in an appendix to our first
volume.^695 We have done so, because they have been so closely connected with the name
of the bishop of Antioch, and also because they are in themselves not destitute of interest.
We have, moreover, the satisfaction of thus placing for the first time within the reach of one
acquainted only with our language, all the materials that have entered into the protracted
agitation of the famous Ignatian controversy.

695 [Spurious writings, if they can be traced to antiquity, are always useful. Sometimes they are evidence of
facts, always of opinions, ideas and fancies of their date; and often they enable us to identify the origin of cor-
ruptions. Even interpolations prove what later partisans would be glad to find, if they could, in early writers.
They bear unwilling testimony to the absence of genuineevidence in favour of their assumptions.]

FromSyria even unto Rome I fight with beasts: not that I am devoured by brute beasts,
for these, as ye know, by the will of God, spared Daniel, but by beasts in the shape of men,
in whom the merciless wild beast himself lies hid, and pricks and wounds me day by day.
But none of these hardships “move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself,”^696 in such
a way as to love it better than the Lord. Wherefore I am prepared for [encountering] fire,
wild beasts, the sword, or the cross, so that only I may see Christ my Saviour and God, who
died for me. I therefore, the prisoner of Christ, who am driven along by land and sea, exhort
you: “stand fast in the faith,”^697 and be ye steadfast, “for the just shall live by faith;”^698 be
ye unwavering, for “the Lord causes those to dwell in a house who are of one and the same

I have learned that certain of the ministers of Satan have wished to disturb you, some
of them asserting that Jesus was born [only^700 ] in appearance, was crucified in appearance,
and died in appearance; others that He is not the Son of the Creator, and others that He is
Himself God over all.^701 Others, again, hold that He is a mere man, and others that this
flesh is not to rise again, so that our proper course is to live and partake of a life of pleasure,
for that this is the chief good to beings who are in a little while to perish. A swarm of such
evils has burst in upon us.^702 But ye have not “given place by subjection to them, no, not
for one hour.”^703 For ye are the fellow-citizens as well as the disciples of Paul, who “fully
preached the Gospel from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum,”^704 and bare about
“the marks of Christ” in his flesh.^705

Mindful of him, do ye by all means know that Jesus the Lord was truly born of Mary,
being made of a woman; and was as truly crucified. For, says he, “God forbid that I should
glory, save in the cross of the Lord Jesus.”^706 And He really suffered, and died, and rose
again. For says [Paul], “If Christ should become passible, and should be the first to rise again
from the dead.”^707 And again, “In that He died, He died unto sin once: but in that He liveth,
He liveth unto God.”^708 Otherwise, what advantage would there be in [becoming subject
to] bonds, if Christ has not died? what advantage in patience? what advantage in [enduring]
stripes? And why such facts as the following: Peter was crucified; Paul and James were slain
with the sword; John was banished to Patmos; Stephen was stoned to death by the Jews who
killed the Lord? But, [in truth,] none of these sufferings were in vain; for the Lord was really
crucified by the ungodly.

Nor is He a mere man, by whom and in whom all things were made; for “all things were

could a mere man be addressed in such words as these: “Sit Thou at My right hand?”^717
And how, again, could such an one declare: “Before Abraham was, I am?”^718 And, “Glorify
Me with Thy glory which I had before the world was?”^719 What man could ever say, “I came
down from heaven, not to do Mine own will, but the will of Him that sent Me?”^720 And of
what man could it be said, “He was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh
into the world: He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and the world knew
Him not. He came unto His own, and His own received Him not?”^721 How could such a
one be a mere man, receiving the beginning of His existence from Mary, and not rather God
the Word, and the only-begotten Son? For “in the beginning was the Word, and the Word
was with God,^722 and the Word was God.”^723 And in another place, “The Lord created Me,

And that our bodies are to rise again, He shows when He says, “Verily I say unto you,
that the hour cometh, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear the voice of the Son
of God; and they that hear shall live.”^725 And [says] the apostle, “For this corruptible must
put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.”^726 And that we must live
soberly and righteously, he [shows when he] says again, “Be not deceived: neither adulterers,
nor effeminate persons, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor fornicators, nor revilers,
nor drunkards, nor thieves, can inherit the kingdom of God.”^727 And again, “If the dead
rise not, then is not Christ raised; our preaching therefore is vain, and your faith is also vain:
ye are yet in your sins. Then they also that are fallen asleep in Christ have perished. If in
this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable. If the dead rise not,
let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.”^728 But if such be our condition and feelings,
wherein shall we differ from asses and dogs, who have no care about the future, but think
only of eating, and of indulging^729 such appetites as follow after eating? For they are unac-
quainted with any intelligence moving within them.

May I have joy of you in the Lord! Be ye sober. Lay aside, every one of you, all malice
and beast-like fury, evil-speaking, calumny, filthy speaking, ribaldry, whispering, arrogance,
drunkenness, lust, avarice, vainglory, envy, and everything akin to these. “But put ye on the
Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.”^730 Ye
presbyters, be subject to the bishop; ye deacons, to the presbyters; and ye, the people, to the
presbyters and the deacons. Let my soul be for theirs who preserve this good order; and may
the Lord be with them continually!

Honour those [who continue] in virginity, as the priestesses of Christ; and the widows [that
persevere] in gravity of behaviour, as the altar of God. Ye servants, wait upon your masters
with [respectful] fear. Ye masters, issue orders to your servants with tenderness. Let no one
among you be idle; for idleness is the mother of want. I do not enjoin these things as being
a person of any consequence, although I am in bonds [for Christ]; but as a brother, I put
you in mind of them. The Lord be with you!

### Chapter I.—Cautions against error.


The Lord has rendered my bonds light and easy since I learnt that you are in peace, that
you live in all harmony both of the flesh and spirit. “I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord,^735
beseech you, that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called,”^736 guarding
against those heresies of the wicked one which have broken in upon us, to the deceiving
and destruction of those that accept of them; but that ye give heed to the doctrine of the
apostles, and believe both the law and the prophets: that ye reject every Jewish and Gentile
error, and neither introduce a multiplicity of gods, nor yet deny Christ under the pretence
of [maintaining] the unity of God.

### Chapter II.—The true doctrine respecting God and Christ.


For Moses, the faithful servant of God, when he said, “The Lord thy God is one Lord,”^737
and thus proclaimed that there was only one God, did yet forthwith confess also our Lord
when he said, “The Lord rained upon Sodom and Gomorrah fire and brimstone from the
Lord.”^738 And again, “And God^739 said, Let Us make man after our image: and so God made
man, after the image of God made He him.”^740 And further, “In the image of God made He
man.”^741 And that [the Son of God] was to be made man, [Moses shows when] he says, “A
prophet shall the Lord raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me.”^742

The prophets also, when they speak as in the person of God, [saying,] “I am God, the

the Father of the universe, do also speak of our Lord Jesus Christ. “A Son,” they say, has
been given to us, on whose shoulder the government is from above; and His name is called
the Angel of great counsel, Wonderful, Counsellor, the strong and mighty God.”^745 And
concerning His incarnation, “Behold, a virgin shall be with Child, and shall bring forth a
Son; and they shall call his name Immanuel.”^746 And concerning the passion, “He was led
as a sheep to the slaughter; and as a lamb before her shearers is dumb, I also was an innocent
lamb led to be sacrificed.”^747

Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All
things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made that was made.”^749
And concerning the incarnation: “The Word,” says [the Scripture], “became flesh, and dwelt
among us.”^750 And again: “The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David,
the son of Abraham.”^751 And those very apostles, who said “that there is one God,”^752 said


111


also that “there is one Mediator between God and men.”^753 Nor were they ashamed of the
incarnation and the passion. For what says [one]? “The man Christ Jesus, who gave Him-

Whosoever, therefore, declares that there is but one God, only so as to take away the

Christ, yet not as the Son of the Maker of the world, but of some other unknown^756 being,
different from Him whom the law and the prophets have proclaimed, this man is an instru-
ment of the devil. And he that rejects the incarnation, and is ashamed of the cross for which
I am in bonds, this man is antichrist.^757 Moreover, he who affirms Christ to be a mere man
is accursed, according to the [declaration of the] prophet,^758 since he puts not his trust in
God, but in man. Wherefore also he is unfruitful, like the wild myrtle-tree.

ware, therefore, of those that hasten to work mischief, those “enemies of the cross of Christ,

the government over you was first entrusted by the apostles. Let us not bring disgrace upon
our Father. Let us prove ourselves His true-born children, and not bastards. Ye know after
what manner I have acted among you. The things which, when present, I spoke to you, these
same, when absent, I now write to you. “If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him
be Anathema.”^763 Be ye followers of me.^764 My soul be for yours, when I attain to Jesus.
Remember my bonds.^765

against the word.^776 Be subject to Cæsar in everything in which subjection implies no

casion against yourselves to those that seek for it. But as to the practice of magic, or the
impure love of boys, or murder, it is superfluous to write to you, since such vices are forbid-

and the Spirit within him, and who is mine own son in faith and love: Grace, mercy, and peace
from Almighty God, and from Christ Jesus our Lord, His only-begotten Son, “who gave Himself
for our sins, that He might deliver us from the present evil world,”^784 and preserve us unto
His heavenly kingdom.

### Chapter I.—Exhortations to earnestness and moderation.


I Exhortthee in God, that thou add [speed] to thy course, and that thou vindicate thy
dignity. Have a care to preserve concord with the saints. Bear [the burdens of] the weak,
that “thou mayest fulfil the law of Christ.”^785 Devote^786 thyself to fasting and prayer, but
not beyond measure, lest thou destroy thyself^787 thereby. Do not altogether abstain from
wine and flesh, for these things are not to be viewed with abhorrence, since [the Scripture]
saith, “Ye shall eat the good things of the earth.”^788 And again, “Ye shall eat flesh even as
herbs.”^789 And again, “Wine maketh glad the heart of man, and oil exhilarates, and bread
strengthens him.”^790 But all are to be used with moderation, as being the gifts of God. “For
who shall eat or who shall drink without Him? For if anything be beautiful, it is His; and if
anything be good, it is His.”^791 Give attention to reading,^792 that thou mayest not only
thyself know the laws, but mayest also explain them to others, as the earnest servant^793 of
God. “No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please
him who hath chosen him to be a soldier; and if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he
not crowned except he strive lawfully.”^794 I that am in bonds pray that my soul may be in

he work miracles, though he have the gift of prophecy, let him be in thy sight as a wolf in
sheep’s clothing,^795 labouring for the destruction of the sheep. If any one denies the cross,
and is ashamed of the passion, let him be to thee as the adversary himself. “Though he gives
all his goods to feed the poor, though he remove mountains, though he give his body to be
burned,”^796 let him be regarded by thee as abominable. If any one makes light of the law or
the prophets, which Christ fulfilled at His coming, let him be to thee as antichrist. If any

for they are priests, and thou a servant of the priests. They baptize, offer sacrifice,^799 ordain,

and lay on hands; but thou ministerest to them, as the holy Stephen did at Jerusalem to
James and the presbyters. Do not neglect the sacred meetings^800 [of the saints]; inquire after

explains it as meaning “to offer sacrifice.” [The whole passage in the Epistle to the Romans, where this word
occurs may be compared (original Greek) with Mal. i. 11, Heb. v. 1, etc.]

### Chapter IV.—Servants and women are not to be despised.


Be not ashamed of servants, for we possess the same nature in common with them. Do
not hold women in abomination, for they have given thee birth, and brought thee up. It is
fitting, therefore, to love those that were the authors of our birth (but only in the Lord),
inasmuch as a man can produce no children without a woman. It is right, therefore, that
we should honour those who have had a part in giving us birth. “Neither is the man without
the woman, nor the woman without the man,”^802 except in the case of those who were first
formed. For the body of Adam was made out of the four elements, and that of Eve out of
the side of Adam. And, indeed, the altogether peculiar birth of the Lord was of a virgin
alone. [This took place] not as if the lawful union [of man and wife] were abominable, but
such a kind of birth was fitting to God. For it became the Creator not to make use of the
ordinary method of generation, but of one that was singular and strange, as being the Cre-
ator.

author is the devil, and his successor Cain, who envied his brother, and out of envy committed
murder. Exhort my sisters to love God, and be content with their own husbands only. In
like manner, exhort my brethren also to be content with their own wives. Watch over the
virgins, as the precious treasures of Christ. Be long-suffering,^805 that thou mayest be great

Beingmindful of your love and of your zeal in Christ, which ye have manifested towards
us, we thought it fitting to write to you, who display such a godly and spiritual love to the
brethren,^816 to put you in remembrance of your Christian course,^817 “that ye all speak the
same thing, being of one mind, thinking the same thing, and walking by the same rule of
faith,”^818 as Paul admonished you. For if there is one God of the universe, the Father of
Christ, “of whom are all things;”^819 and one Lord Jesus Christ, our [Lord], “by whom are
all things;”^820 and also one Holy Spirit, who wrought^821 in Moses, and in the prophets and
apostles; and also one baptism, which is administered that we should have fellowship with
the death of the Lord;^822 and also one elect Church; there ought likewise to be but one faith
in respect to Christ. For “there is one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of
all, who is through all, and in all.”^823

There is then one God and Father, and not two or three; One who is; and there is no
other besides Him, the only true [God]. For “the Lord thy God,” saith [the Scripture], “is
one Lord.”^824 And again, “Hath not one God created us? Have we not all one Father?^825
And there is also one Son, God the Word. For “the only-begotten Son,” saith [the Scripture],
“who is in the bosom of the Father.”^826 And again, “One Lord Jesus Christ.”^827 And in an-
other place, “What is His name, or what His Son’s name, that we may know?”^828 And there
is also one Paraclete.^829 For “there is also,” saith [the Scripture], “one Spirit,”^830 since “we
have been called in one hope of our calling.”^831 And again, “We have drunk of one Spirit,”^832
with what follows. And it is manifest that all these gifts [possessed by believers] “worketh
one and the self-same Spirit.”^833 There are not then either three Fathers,^834 or three Sons,
or three Paracletes, but one Father, and one Son, and one Paraclete. Wherefore also the
Lord, when He sent forth the apostles to make disciples of all nations, commanded them to
“baptize in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,”^835 not unto one
[person] having three names, nor into three [persons] who became incarnate, but into three
possessed of equal honour.

### Chapter III.—Christ was truly born, and died.


For there is but One that became incarnate, and that neither the Father nor the Paraclete,
but the Son only, [who became so] not in appearance or imagination, but in reality. For “the
Word became flesh.”^836 For “Wisdom builded for herself a house.”^837 And God the Word
was born as man, with a body, of the Virgin, without any intercourse of man. For [it is
written], “A virgin shall conceive in her womb, and bring forth a son.”^838 He was then truly
born, truly grew up, truly ate and drank, was truly crucified, and died, and rose again. He


117


who believes these things, as they really were, and as they really took place, is blessed. He
who believeth them not is no less accursed than those who crucified the Lord. For the prince
of this world rejoiceth when any one denies the cross, since he knows that the confession
of the cross is his own destruction. For that is the trophy which has been raised up against
his power, which when he sees, he shudders, and when he hears of, is afraid.

### Chapter IV.—The malignity and folly of Satan.


And indeed, before the cross was erected, he (Satan) was eager that it should be so; and
he “wrought” [for this end] “in the children of disobedience.”^839 He wrought in Judas, in
the Pharisees, in the Sadducees, in the old, in the young, and in the priests. But when it was
just about to be erected, he was troubled, and infused repentance into the traitor, and
pointed him to a rope to hang himself with, and taught him [to die by] strangulation. He
terrified also the silly woman, disturbing her by dreams; and he, who had tried every means
to have the cross prepared, now endeavoured to put a stop to its erection;^840 not that he
was influenced by repentance on account of the greatness of his crime (for in that case he
would not be utterly depraved), but because he perceived his own destruction [to be at
hand]. For the cross of Christ was the beginning of his condemnation, the beginning of his
death, the beginning of his destruction. Wherefore, also, he works in some that they should
deny the cross, be ashamed of the passion, call the death an appearance, mutilate and explain
away the birth of the Virgin, and calumniate the [human] nature^841 itself as being abomin-
able. He fights along with the Jews to a denial of the cross, and with the Gentiles to the ca-
lumniating of Mary,^842 who are heretical in holding that Christ possessed a mere phantasmal
body.^843 For the leader of all wickedness assumes manifold^844 forms, beguiler of men as he
is, inconsistent, and even contradicting himself, projecting one course and then following
another. For he is wise to do evil, but as to what good may be he is totally ignorant. And
indeed he is full of ignorance, on account of his voluntary want of reason: for how can he
be deemed anything else who does not perceive reason when it lies at his very feet?


839 Eph. ii. 2.
840 [This is the idea worked out by St. Bernard. See my note (supra)suffixed to the Syriac Epistle to Ephesians.]
841 The various Gnostic sects are here referred to, who held that matter was essentially evil, and therefore
denied the reality of our Lord’s incarnation.

### Chapter V.—Apostrophe to Satan.


For if the Lord were a mere man, possessed of a soul and body only, why dost thou
mutilate and explain away His being born with the common nature of humanity? Why dost
thou call the passion a mere appearance, as if it were any strange thing happening to a [mere]
man? And why dost thou reckon the death of a mortal to be simply an imaginary death?
But if, [on the other hand,] He is both God and man, then why dost thou call it unlawful to
style Him “the Lord of glory,”^845 who is by nature unchangeable? Why dost thou say that
it is unlawful to declare of the Lawgiver who possesses a human soul, “The Word was made
flesh,”^846 and was a perfect man, and not merely one dwelling in a man? But how came this
magician into existence, who of old formed all nature that can be apprehended either by
the senses or intellect, according to the will of the Father; and, when He became incarnate,
healed every kind of disease and infirmity?^847

And how can He be but God, who raises up the dead, sends away the lame sound of
limb, cleanses the lepers, restores sight to the blind, and either increases or transmutes ex-
isting substances, as the five loaves and the two fishes, and the water which became wine,
and who puts to flight thy whole host by a mere word? And why dost thou abuse the nature
of the Virgin, and style her members disgraceful, since thou didst of old display such in
public processions,^848 and didst order them to be exhibited naked, males in the sight of fe-
males, and females to stir up the unbridled lust of males? But now these are reckoned by
thee disgraceful, and thou pretendest to be full of modesty, thou spirit of fornication, not
knowing that then only anything becomes disgraceful when it is polluted by wickedness.
But when sin is not present, none of the things that have been created are shameful, none
of them evil, but all very good. But inasmuch as thou art blind, thou revilest these things.

And how, again, does Christ not at all appear to thee to be of the Virgin, but to be God
over all,^849 and the Almighty? Say, then, who sent Him? Who was Lord over Him? And
whose will did He obey? And what laws did He fulfil, since He was subject neither to the
will nor power of any one? And while you deny that Christ was born,^850 you affirm that the


118


unbegotten was begotten, and that He who had no beginning was nailed to the cross, by
whose permission I am unable to say. But thy changeable tactics do not escape me, nor am
I ignorant that thou art wont to walk with slanting and uncertain^851 steps. And thou art
ignorant who really was born, thou who pretendest to know everything.

For many things are unknown^852 to thee; [such as the following]: the virginity of Mary;
the wonderful birth; Who it was that became incarnate; the star which guided those who
were in the east; the Magi who presented gifts; the salutation of the archangel to the Virgin;
the marvellous conception of her that was betrothed; the announcement of the boy-forerun-
ner respecting the son of the Virgin, and his leaping in the womb on account of what was
foreseen; the songs of the angels over Him that was born; the glad tidings announced to the
shepherds; the fear of Herod lest his kingdom should be taken from him; the command to
slay the infants; the removal into Egypt, and the return from that country to the same region;
the infant swaddling-bands; the human registration; the nourishing by means of milk; the
name of father given to Him who did not beget; the manger because there was not room
[elsewhere]; no human preparation [for the Child]; the gradual growth, human speech,
hunger, thirst, journeyings, weariness; the offering of sacrifices, and then also circumcision,
baptism; the voice of God over Him that was baptized, as to who He was and whence [He
had come]; the testimony of the Spirit and the Father from above; the voice of John the
prophet when it signified the passion by the appellation of “the Lamb;” the performance of
divers miracles, manifold healings; the rebuke of the Lord ruling both the sea and the winds;
evil spirits expelled; thou thyself subjected to torture, and, when afflicted by the power of
Him who had been manifested, not having it in thy power to do anything.

with Christ. [See my note at end of the Syriac Epistle to Ephesians, supra.]

### Chapter IX.—Continuation: ignorance of Satan.


Seeing these things, thou wast in utter perplexity.^853 And thou wast ignorant that it was
a virgin that should bring forth; but the angels’ song of praise struck thee with astonishment,
as well as the adoration of the Magi, and the appearance of the star. Thou didst revert to thy
state of [wilful] ignorance, because all the circumstances seemed to thee trifling;^854 for thou
didst deem the swaddling-bands, the circumcision, and the nourishment by means of milk
contemptible:^855 these things appeared to thee unworthy of God. Again, thou didst behold
a man who remained forty days and nights without tasting human food, along with minis-
tering angels at whose presence thou didst shudder, when first of all thou hadst seen Him
baptized as a common man, and knewest not the reason thereof. But after His [lengthened]
fast thou didst again assume thy wonted audacity, and didst tempt Him when hungry, as if
He had been an ordinary man, not knowing who He was. For thou saidst, “If thou be the
Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.”^856 Now, this expression, “If thou
be the Son,” is an indication of ignorance. For if thou hadst possessed real knowledge, thou
wouldst have understood that the Creator can with equal ease both create what does not
exist, and change that which already has a being. And thou temptedst by means of hunger^857
Him who nourisheth all that require food. And thou temptedst the very “Lord of glory,”^858
forgetting in thy malevolence that “man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word
that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.” For if thou hadst known that He was the Son of
God, thou wouldst also have understood that He who had kept his^859 body from feeling
any want for forty days and as many nights, could have also done the same for ever. Why,
then, does He suffer hunger? In order to prove that He had assumed a body subject to the
same feelings as those of ordinary men. By the first fact He showed that He was God, and
by the second that He was also man.

reckoned as if they were,^862 and to provoke to a display of vainglory Him that was free from
all ostentation? And didst thou pretend to read in Scripture concerning Him: “For He hath
given His angels charge concerning Thee, and in their hands they shall bear Thee up, lest
thou shouldest dash Thy foot against a stone?”^863 At the same time thou didst pretend to
be ignorant of the rest, furtively concealing what [the Scripture] predicted concerning thee
and thy servants: “Thou shalt tread upon the adder and the basilisk; the lion and the dragon
shall thou trample under foot.”^864

If, therefore, thou art trodden down under the feet of the Lord, how dost thou tempt
Him that cannot be tempted, forgetting that precept of the lawgiver, “Thou shall not tempt
the Lord thy God?”^865 Yea, thou even darest, most accursed one, to appropriate the works
of God to thyself, and to declare that the dominion over these was delivered to thee.^866 And
thou dost set forth thine own fall as an example to the Lord, and dost promise to give Him
what is really His own, if He would fall down and worship thee.^867 And how didst thou not
shudder, O thou spirit more wicked through thy malevolence than all other wicked spirits,
to utter such words against the Lord? Through thine appetite^868 wast thou overcome, and
through thy vainglory wast thou brought to dishonour: through avarice and ambition dost
thou [now] draw on [others] to ungodliness. Thou, O Belial, dragon, apostate, crooked
serpent, rebel against God, outcast from Christ, alien from the Holy Spirit, exile from the
ranks of the angels, reviler of the laws of God, enemy of all that is lawful, who didst rise up
against the first-formed of men, and didst drive forth [from obedience to] the commandment
[of God] those who had in no respect injured thee; thou who didst raise up against Abel the
murderous Cain; thou who didst take arms against Job: dost thou say to the Lord, “If Thou
wilt fall down and worship me?” Oh what audacity! Oh what madness! Thou runaway slave,
thou incorrigible^869 slave, dost thou rebel against the good Lord? Dost thou say to so great
a Lord, the God of all that either the mind or the senses can perceive, “If Thou wilt fall down
and worship me?”

“Get thee behind Me,” for it is not possible that he should be converted; but, “Begone, Satan,”
to the course which thou hast chosen. “Begone” to those things to which, through thy
malevolence, thou hast been called. For I know Who I am, and by Whom I have been sent,
and Whom it behoves Me to worship. For “thou shall worship the Lord thy God, and Him
only shalt thou serve.”^871 I know the one [God]; I am acquainted with the only [Lord] from
whom thou hast become an apostate. I am not an enemy of God; I acknowledge His pre-
eminence; I know the Father, who is the author of my generation.

These things, brethren, out of the affection which I entertain for you, I have felt com-

any consequence, but simply as a brother. Be ye subject to the bishop, to the presbyters, and
to the deacons. Love one another in the Lord, as being the images of God. Take heed, ye
husbands, that ye love your wives as your own members. Ye wives also, love your husbands,
as being one with them in virtue of your union. If any one lives in chastity or continence,
let him not be lifted up, lest he lose his reward. Do not lightly esteem the festivals. Despise
not the period of forty days, for it comprises an imitation of the conduct of the Lord. After
the week of the passion, do not neglect to fast on the fourth and sixth days, distributing at
the same time of thine abundance to the poor. If any one fasts on the Lord’s Day or on the
Sabbath, except on the paschal Sabbath only, he is a murderer of Christ.

of God, and very faithful, happening to meet with him at Rhegium, just as he was going on
board ship. Remember my bonds^872 that I may be made perfect in Christ. Fare ye well in

to thee by Christ, and thou wilt remember^883 that Samuel, while yet a little child, was called
a seer, and was reckoned in the company of the prophets, that he reproved the aged Eli for
transgression, since he had honoured his infatuated sons above God the author of all things,

ridicule, and acted violently towards thy people.

And Jeremiah, when on account of his youth he declined the office of a prophet entrusted
to him by God, was addressed in these words: “Say not, I am a youth; for thou shalt go to
all those to whom I send thee, and thou shalt speak according to all that I command thee;
because I am with thee.”^885 And the wise Solomon, when only in the twelfth year of his
age,^886 had wisdom to decide the important question concerning the children of the two
women,^887 when it was unknown to whom these respectively belonged; so that the whole
people were astonished at such wisdom in a child, and venerated him as being not a mere
youth, but a full-grown man. And he solved the hard questions of the queen of the
Ethiopians, which had profit in them as the streams of the Nile [have fertility], in such a

the place where sacrifices were offered with dead bodies, and throws down the temples, and
cuts down the groves, and breaks in pieces the pillars, and breaks open the tombs of the
ungodly, that not a relic of the wicked might any longer exist.^889 To such an extent did he
display zeal in the cause of godliness, and prove himself a punisher of the ungodly, while
he as yet faltered in speech like a child. David, too, who was at once a prophet and a king,

Sightindeed is better than writing, inasmuch as, being one^894 of the company of the
senses, it not only, by communicating proofs of friendship, honours him who receives them,
but also, by those which it in turn receives, enriches the desire for better things. But the
second harbour of refuge, as the phrase runs, is the practice of writing, which we have re-
ceived, as a convenient haven, by thy faith, from so great a distance, seeing that by means
of a letter we have learned the excellence that is in thee. For the souls of the good, O thou
wisest^895 of women! resemble fountains of the purest water; for they allure by their beauty
passers-by to drink of them, even though these should not be thirsty. And thy intelligence
invites us, as by a word of command, to participate in those divine draughts which gush
forth so abundantly in thy soul.

me, seeing that “the sufferings of this present time are not worthy [to be compared] with

whom thou didst prove to be men of worth. For I am sure that thou barest testimony to
them in the exercise of a godly judgment,^899 and not through the influence of carnal favour.
And thy numerous quotations of Scripture passages exceedingly delighted me, which, when
I had read, I had no longer a single doubtful thought respecting the matter. For I did not
hold that those things were simply to be glanced over by my eyes, of which I had received
from thee such an incontrovertible demonstration. May I be in place of thy soul, because
thou lovest Jesus, the Son of the living God. Wherefore also He Himself says to thee, “I love

Now it occurs to me to mention, that the report is true which I heard of thee whilst thou
wast at Rome with the blessed father^901 Linus, whom the deservedly-blessed Clement, a

fold to thy reputation; and may thou, O woman! still further increase it. I greatly desired to
come unto you, that I might have rest with you; but “the way of man is not in himself.”^902
For the military guard [under which I am kept] hinders my purpose, and does not permit
me to go further. Nor indeed, in the state I am now in, can I either do or suffer anything.

Wherefore deeming the practice of writing the second resource of friends for their mutual

also to exhort others in Christ. Salute all that are like-minded with thyself, and who hold
fast to their salvation in Christ. The presbyters and deacons, and above all the holy Hero,

### Ignatius, and the brethren who are with him, to John the holy presbyter.


Weare deeply grieved at thy delay in strengthening us by thy addresses and consolations.
If thy absence be prolonged, it will disappoint many of us. Hasten then to come, for we believe
that it is expedient. There are also many of our women here, who are desirous to see Mary
[the mother] of Jesus, and wish day by day to run off from us to you, that they may meet
with her, and touch those breasts of hers which nourished the Lord Jesus, and may inquire
of her respecting some rather secret matters. But Salome also, [the daughter of Anna,] whom
thou lovest, who stayed with her five months at Jerusalem, and some other well-known
persons, relate that she is full of all graces and all virtues, after the manner of a virgin,
fruitful in virtue and grace. And, as they report, she is cheerful in persecutions and afflictions,
free from murmuring in the midst of penury and want, grateful to those that injure her, and
rejoices when exposed to troubles: she sympathizes with the wretched and the afflicted as
sharing in their afflictions, and is not slow to come to their assistance. Moreover, she shines
forth gloriously as contending in the fight of faith against the pernicious conflicts of vicious^903
principles or conduct. She is the lady of our new religion and repentance,^904 and the hand-
maid among the faithful of all works of piety. She is indeed devoted to the humble, and she
humbles herself more devotedly than the devoted, and is wonderfully magnified by all, while
at the same time she suffers detraction from the Scribes and Pharisees. Besides these points,
many relate to us numerous other things regarding her. We do not, however, go so far as
to believe all in every particular; nor do we mention such to thee. But, as we are informed
by those who are worthy of credit, there is in Mary the mother of Jesus an angelic purity of
nature allied with the nature of humanity.^905 And such reports as these have greatly excited
our emotions, and urge us eagerly to desire a sight of this (if it be lawful so to speak) heavenly
prodigy and most sacred marvel. But do thou in haste comply with this our desire; and fare
thou well. Amen.


903 Literally, “of vices.”
904 Some mss. and editions seem with propriety to omit this word.

If thou wilt give me leave, I desire to go up to Jerusalem, and see the faithful^907 saints

and of affection to all. For who would not rejoice to behold and to address her who bore
the true God from her^908 own womb, provided he is a friend of our faith and religion? And
in like manner [I desire to see] the venerable James, who is surnamed Just, whom they relate
to be very like Christ Jesus in appearance,^909 in life, and in method of conduct, as if he were
a twin-brother of the same womb. They say that, if I see him, I see also Jesus Himself, as to
all the features and aspect of His body. Moreover, [I desire to see] the other saints, both
male and female. Alas! why do I delay? Why am I kept back? Kind^910 teacher, bid me hasten

## Introductory Note to the Martyrdom of Ignatius


The learned dissertation of Pearson, on the difficulties of reconciling the supposed year
of the martyrdom with the history of Trajan, etc., is given entire in Jacobson (vol. ii. p. 524),
against the decision of Usher for a.d. 107. Pearson accepts a.d. 116. Consult also the preface
of Dr. Thomas Smith,^914 in the same work (p. 518), on the text of the original and of the
Latin versions, and on the credibility of the narrative. Our learned translators seem to think
the text they have used, to be without interpolation. If the simple-minded faithful of those
days, so near the age of miracles, appear to us, in some degree, enthusiasts, let us remember
the vision of Col. Gardiner, accredited by Doddridge, Lord Lyttleton’s vision (see Boswell,
anno1784, chap. xi.), accepted by Johnson and his contemporaries, and the interesting
narrative of the pious Mr. Tennent of New Jersey, attested by so many excellent and intelligent
persons, almost of our own times.
The following is the Introductory Noticeof the translators:—
The following account of the martyrdom of Ignatius professes, in several passages, to
have been written by those who accompanied him on his voyage to Rome, and were present
on the occasion of his death (chaps. v. vi. vii.). And if the genuineness of this narrative, as
well as of the Ignatian Epistles, be admitted, there can be little doubt that the persons in
question were Philo and Agathopus, with Crocus perhaps, all of whom are mentioned by
Ignatius (Epist. to Smyr., chap. x.; to Philad., chap. xi.; to Rom., chap. x.) as having attended
him on that journey to Rome which resulted in his martyrdom. But doubts have been started,
by Daillé and others, as to the date and authorship of this account. Some of these rest upon
internal considerations, but the weightiest objection is found in the fact that no reference
to this narrative is to be traced during the first six centuries of our era.^915 This is certainly
a very suspicious circumstance, and may well give rise to some hesitation in ascribing the
authorship to the immediate companions and friends of Ignatius. On the other hand, how-
ever, this account of the death of Ignatius is in perfect harmony with the particulars recounted
by Eusebius and Chrysostom regarding him. Its comparative simplicity, too, is greatly in
its favour. It makes no reference to the legends which by and by connected themselves with
the name of Ignatius. As is well known, he came in course of time to be identified with the
child whom Christ (Matt. xviii. 2) set before His disciples as a pattern of humility. It was


914 He published an edition of Ignatius, Oxford, 1709.
915 [A most remarkable statement. “References” may surely be traced, at least in Eusebius (iii. 36) and Irenæus
(Adv. Hæres.v. 28), if not in Jerome, etc. But the sermon of St. Chrysostom (Opp. ii. 593) seems almost, in parts,
a paraphrase.]

said that the Saviour took him up in His arms, and that hence Ignatius derived his name
of Theophorus;^916 that is, according to the explanation which this legend gives of the word,
one carried by God. But in chap. ii. of the following narrative we find the term explained to
mean, “one who has Christ in his breast;” and this simple explanation, with the entire silence
preserved as to the marvels afterwards connected with the name of Ignatius, is certainly a
strong argument in favour of the early date and probable genuineness of the account. Some
critics, such as Usher and Grabe, have reckoned the latter part of the narrative spurious,
while accepting the former; but there appears to be a unity about it which requires us either
to accept it in toto, or to reject it altogether.^917

916 [See on this matter Jacobson’s note (vol ii. p. 262), and reference to Pearson (Vind. Ignat., part ii. cap.
12). The false accentuation (Θεόφορος) occurs in some copies to support the myth of the child Ignatius as the
God-borneinstead of the God-bearing; i.e., carried by Christ, instead of carrying the Spirit of Christ within.]

## The Martyrdom of Ignatius

#### The Martyrdom of Ignatius


The Martyrdom of Ignatius


### Chapter I.—Desire of Ignatius for martyrdom.


WhenTrajan, not long since,^918 succeeded to the empire of the Romans, Ignatius, the
disciple of John the apostle, a man in all respects of an apostolic character, governed the
Church of the Antiochians with great care, having with difficulty escaped the former storms
of the many persecutions under Domitian, inasmuch as, like a good pilot, by the helm of
prayer and fasting, by the earnestness of his teaching, and by his [constant^919 ] spiritual labour,
he resisted the flood that rolled against him, fearing [only] lest he should lose any of those
who were deficient in courage, or apt to suffer from their simplicity.^920 Wherefore he rejoiced
over the tranquil state of the Church, when the persecution ceased for a little time, but was
grieved as to himself, that he had not yet attained to a true love to Christ, nor reached the
perfect rank of a disciple. For he inwardly reflected, that the confession which is made by
martyrdom, would bring him into a yet more intimate relation to the Lord. Wherefore,
continuing a few years longer with the Church, and, like a divine lamp, enlightening every
one’s understanding by his expositions of the [Holy^921 ] Scriptures, he [at length] attained
the object of his desire.


918 The date of Trajan’s accession was a.d. 98.
919 The text here is somewhat doubtful.
920 Literally, “any of the faint-hearted and more guileless.”
921 This word is of doubtful authority.

### Chapter II.—Ignatius is condemned by Trajan.


For Trajan, in the ninth^922 year of his reign, being lifted up [with pride], after the victory
he had gained over the Scythians and Dacians, and many other nations, and thinking that
the religious body of the Christians were yet wanting to complete the subjugation of all
things to himself, and [thereupon] threatening them with persecution unless they should
agree to^923 worship dæmons, as did all other nations, thus compelled^924 all who were living
godly lives either to sacrifice [to idols] or die. Wherefore the noble soldier of Christ [Ignatius],
being in fear for the Church of the Antiochians, was, in accordance with his own desire,
brought before Trajan, who was at that time staying at Antioch, but was in haste [to set
forth] against Armenia and the Parthians. And when he was set before the emperor Trajan,
[that prince] said unto him, “Who art thou, wicked wretch,^925 who settest^926 thyself to
transgress our commands, and persuadest others to do the same, so that they should
miserably perish?” Ignatius replied, “No one ought to call Theophorus^927 wicked; for all
evil spirits^928 have departed from the servants of God. But if, because I am an enemy to
these [spirits], you call me wicked in respect to them, I quite agree with you; for inasmuch
as I have Christ the King of heaven [within me], I destroy all the devices of these [evil spirits].”
Trajan answered, “And who is Theophorus?” Ignatius replied, “He who has Christ within
his breast.” Trajan said, “Do wenot then seem to you to have the gods in our mind, whose
assistance we enjoy in fighting against our enemies?” Ignatius answered, “Thou art in error
when thou callest the dæmons of the nations gods. For there is but one God, who made
heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that are in them; and one Jesus Christ, the only-be-
gotten Son of God, whose kingdom may I enjoy.” Trajan said, “Do you mean Him who was
crucified under Pontius Pilate?” Ignatius replied, “I mean Him who crucified my sin, with
him who was the inventor of it,^929 and who has condemned [and cast down] all the deceit
and malice of the devil under the feet of those who carry Him in their heart.” Trajan said,
“Dost thou then carry within thee Him that was crucified?” Ignatius replied, “Truly so; for


922 The numeral is uncertain. In the old Latin version we find “the fourth,” which Grabe has corrected into
the nineteenth. The choice lies between “ninth” and “nineteenth,” i.e., a.d. 107 or a.d. 116.
923 Literally, “would choose to submit to.”
924 Some read, “fear compelled.”
925 Literally, “evil-dæmon.”
926 Literally, “art zealous.”

it is written, ‘I will dwell in them, and walk in them.’ ”^930 Then Trajan pronounced sentence
as follows: “We command that Ignatius, who affirms that he carries about within him Him
that was crucified, be bound by soldiers, and carried to the great [city] Rome, there to be
devoured by the beasts, for the gratification of the people.” When the holy martyr heard
this sentence, he cried out with joy, “I thank thee, O Lord, that Thou hast vouchsafed to
honour me with a perfect love towards Thee, and hast made me to be bound with iron
chains, like^931 Thy Apostle Paul.” Having spoken thus, he then, with delight, clasped the
chains about him; and when he had first prayed for the Church, and commended it with
tears to the Lord, he was hurried away by the savage cruelty^932 of the soldiers, like a distin-
guished ram^933 the leader of a goodly flock, that he might be carried to Rome, there to furnish
food to the bloodthirsty beasts.

### Chapter III.—Ignatius sails to Smyrna.


Wherefore, with great alacrity and joy, through his desire to suffer, he came down from
Antioch to Seleucia, from which place he set sail. And after a great deal of suffering he came
to Smyrna, where he disembarked with great joy, and hastened to see the holy Polycarp,
[formerly] his fellow-disciple, and [now] bishop of Smyrna. For they had both, in old times,
been disciples of St. John the Apostle. Being then brought to him, and having communicated
to him some spiritual gifts, and glorying in his bonds, he entreated of him to labour^934 along
with him for the fulfilment of his desire; earnestly indeed asking this of the whole Church
(for the cities and Churches of Asia had welcomed^935 the holy man through their bishops,
and presbyters, and deacons, all hastening to meet him, if by any means they might receive
from him some^936 spiritual gift), but above all, the holy Polycarp, that, by means of the wild
beasts, he soon disappearing from this world, might be manifested before the face of Christ.


934 It is doubtful if this clause should be referred to Polycarp.
935 Or, “received.”
936 Literally, “a portion of.”

### Chapter IV.—Ignatius writes to the churches.


And these things he thus spake, and thus testified, extending his love to Christ so far as
one who was about to^937 secure heaven through his good confession, and the earnestness
of those who joined their prayers to his in regard to his [approaching] conflict; and to give
a recompense to the Churches, who came to meet him through their rulers, sending^938 letters
of thanksgiving to them, which dropped spiritual grace, along with prayer and exhortation.
Wherefore, seeing all men so kindly affected towards him, and fearing lest the love of the
brotherhood should hinder his zeal towards the Lord,^939 while a fair door of suffering
martyrdom was opened to him, he wrote to the Church of the Romans the Epistle which is
here subjoined.
(See the Epistle as formerly given.)


937 The Latin version has, “that he was to.” [But compare the martyr’s Epistle to the Romans (cap. 5); “yet
am I not thereby justified,” —a double reference to St. Paul’s doctrine, 1 Cor. iv. 4 and 1 Cor. xiii. 3. See also his
quotation (Sept., Prov. xviii. 17). Epistle to Magnesians, cap 12.]

Having therefore, by means of this Epistle, settled,^940 as he wished, those of the brethren
at Rome who were unwilling [for his martyrdom]; and setting sail from Smyrna (for Chris-
tophorus was pressed by the soldiers to hasten to the public spectacles in the mighty [city]
Rome, that, being given up to the wild beasts in the sight of the Roman people, he might
attain to the crown for which he strove), he [next] landed at Troas. Then, going on from
that place to Neapolis, he went [on foot] by Philippi through Macedonia, and on to that
part of Epirus which is near Epidamnus; and finding a ship in one of the seaports, he sailed
over the Adriatic Sea, and entering from it on the Tyrrhene, he passed by the various islands
and cities, until, when Puteoli came in sight, he was eager there to disembark, having a desire
to tread in the footsteps of the Apostle Paul.^941 But a violent wind arising did not suffer him
to do so, the ship being driven rapidly forwards;^942 and, simply expressing his delight^943
over the love of the brethren in that place, he sailed by. Wherefore, continuing to enjoy fair
winds, we were reluctantly hurried on in one day and a night, mourning [as we did] over
the coming departure from us of this righteous man. But to him this happened just as he
wished, since he was in haste as soon as possible to leave this world, that he might attain to
the Lord whom he loved. Sailing then into the Roman harbour, and the unhallowed sports
being just about to close, the soldiers began to be annoyed at our slowness, but the bishop
rejoicingly yielded to their urgency.

They pushed forth therefore from the place which is called Portus;^944 and (the^945 fame


131


of all relating to the holy martyr being already spread abroad) we met the brethren full of
fear and joy; rejoicing indeed because they were thought worthy to meet with Theophorus,
but struck with fear because so eminent a man was being led to death. Now he enjoined
some to keep silence who, in their fervent zeal, were saying^946 that they would appease the
people, so that they should not demand the destruction of this just one. He being immediately
aware of this through the Spirit,^947 and having saluted them all, and begged of them to show
a true affection towards him, and having dwelt [on this point] at greater length than in his
Epistle,^948 and having persuaded them not to envy him hastening to the Lord, he then, after
he had, with all the brethren kneeling [beside him], entreated the Son of God in behalf of
the Churches, that a stop might be put to the persecution, and that mutual love might con-
tinue among the brethren, was led with all haste into the amphitheatre. Then, being imme-
diately thrown in, according to the command of Cæsar given some time ago, the public
spectacles being just about to close (for it was then a solemn day, as they deemed it, being
that which is called the thirteenth^949 in the Roman tongue, on which the people were wont
to assemble in more than ordinary numbers^950 ), he was thus cast to the wild beasts close
beside the temple,^951 that so by them the desire of the holy martyr Ignatius should be fulfilled,
according to that which is written, “The desire of the righteous is acceptable^952 [to God],”
to the effect that he might not be troublesome to any of the brethren by the gathering of his
remains, even as he had in his Epistle expressed a wish beforehand that so his end might
be. For only the harder portions of his holy remains were left, which were conveyed to An-
tioch and wrapped^953 in linen, as an inestimable treasure left to the holy Church by the
grace which was in the martyr.

Now these things took place on the thirteenth day before the Kalends of January, that
is, on the twentieth of December,^954 Sura and Senecio being then the consuls of the Romans
for the second time. Having ourselves been eye-witnesses of these things, and having spent
the whole night in tears within the house, and having entreated the Lord, with bended knees
and much prayer, that He would give us weak men full assurance respecting the things
which were done,^955 it came to pass, on our falling into a brief slumber, that some of us saw
the blessed Ignatius suddenly standing by us and embracing us, while others beheld him
again praying for us, and others still saw him dropping with sweat, as if he had just come
from his great labour, and standing by the Lord. When, therefore, we had with great joy
witnessed these things, and had compared our several visions^956 together, we sang praise
to God, the giver of all good things, and expressed our sense of the happiness of the holy
[martyr]; and now we have made known to you both the day and the time [when these
things happened], that, assembling ourselves together according to the time of his martyrdom,
we may have fellowship with the champion and noble martyr of Christ, who trod under
foot the devil, and perfected the course which, out of love to Christ, he had desired, in Christ
Jesus our Lord; by whom, and with whom, be glory and power to the Father, with the Holy
Spirit, for evermore! Amen.
