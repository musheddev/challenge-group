**### Introductory Note to the Epistle of Polycarp to the Philippians**





[a.d. 65–100–155.] The Epistle of Polycarp is usually made a sort of preface to those of

Ignatius, for reasons which will be obvious to the reader. Yet he was born later, and lived

to a much later period. They seem to have been friends from the days of their common pu-

pilage under St. John; and there is nothing improbable in the conjecture of Usher, that he

was the “angel of the church in Smyrna,” to whom the Master says, “Be thou faithful unto

death, and I will give thee a crown of life.” His pupil Irenæus gives us one of the very few

portraits of an apostolic man which are to be found in antiquity, in a few sentences which

are a picture: “I could describe the very place in which the blessed Polycarp sat and taught;

his going out and coming in; the whole tenor of his life; his personal appearance; how he

would speak of the conversations he had held with John and with others who had seen the

Lord. How did he make mention of their words and of whatever he had heard from them

respecting the Lord.” Thus he unconsciously tantalizes our reverent curiosity. Alas! that

such conversations were not written for our learning. But there is a wise Providence in what

is withheld, as well as in the inestimable treasures we have received.

Irenæus will tell us more concerning him, his visit to Rome, his rebuke of Marcion, and

incidental anecdotes, all which are instructive. The expression which he applied to Marcion

is found in this Epistle. Other facts of interest are found in the Martyrdom, which follows

in these pages. His death, in extreme old age under the first of the Antonines, has been

variously dated; but we may accept the date we have given, as rendered probable by that of

the Paschal question, which he so lovingly settled with Anicetus, Bishop of Rome.

The Epistle to the Philippians is the more interesting as denoting the state of that beloved

church, the firstborn of European churches, and so greatly endeared to St. Paul. It abounds

in practical wisdom, and is rich in Scripture and Scriptural allusions. It reflects the spirit of

St. John, alike in its lamb-like and its aquiline features: he is as loving as the beloved disciple

himself when he speaks of Christ and his church, but “the son of thunder” is echoed in his

rebukes of threatened corruptions in faith and morals. Nothing can be more clear than his

view of the doctrines of grace; but he writes like the disciple of St. John, though in perfect

harmony with St. Paul’s hymn-like eulogy of Christian love.

The following is the original Introductory Notice:—

The authenticity of the following Epistle can on no fair grounds be questioned. It is

abundantly established by external testimony, and is also supported by the internal evidence.

Irenæus says (Adv. Hær., iii. 3): “There is extant an Epistle of Polycarp written to the Philip-

pians, most satisfactory, from which those that have a mind to do so may learn the character

of his faith,” etc. This passage is embodied by Eusebius in his Ecclesiastical History(iv. 14);

and in another place the same writer refers to the Epistle before us as an undoubted produc-

tion of Polycarp (Hist. Eccl., iii. 36). Other ancient testimonies might easily be added, but

are superfluous, inasmuch as there is a general consent among scholars at the present day

that we have in this letter an authentic production of the renowned Bishop of Smyrna.

Of Polycarp’s life little is known, but that little is highly interesting. Irenæus was his

disciple, and tells us that “Polycarp was instructed by the apostles, and was brought into

contact with many who had seen Christ” (Adv. Hær., iii. 3; Euseb. Hist. Eccl., iv. 14). There

is also a very graphic account given of Polycarp by Irenæus in his Epistle to Florinus, to

which the reader is referred. It has been preserved by Eusebius (Hist. Eccl., v. 20).

The Epistle before us is not perfect in any of the Greek mss. which contain it. But the

chapters wanting in Greek are contained in an ancient Latin version. While there is no

ground for supposing, as some have done, that the whole Epistle is spurious, there seems

considerable force in the arguments by which many others have sought to prove chap. xiii.

to be an interpolation.

The date of the Epistle cannot be satisfactorily determined. It depends on the conclusion

we reach as to some points, very difficult and obscure, connected with that account of the

martyrdom of Polycarp which has come down to us. We shall not, however, probably be

far wrong if we fix it about the middle of the second century.

**### The Epistle of Polycarp to the Philippians^1**





Polycarp, and the presbyters^2 with him, to the Church of God sojourning at Philippi:

Mercy to you, and peace from God Almighty, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, our Saviour,

be multiplied.





1 The title of this Epistle in most of the mss. is, “The Epistle of St. Polycarp, Bishop of Smyrna, and holy

martyr, to the Philippians.”

2 Or, “Polycarp, and those who with him are presbyters.”

**#### Chapter I.—Praise of the Philippians.**





I have greatly rejoiced with you in our Lord Jesus Christ, because ye have followed the

example^3 of true love [as displayed by God], and have accompanied, as became you, those

who were bound in chains, the fitting ornaments of saints, and which are indeed the diadems

of the true elect of God and our Lord; and because the strong root of your faith, spoken of

in days^4 long gone by, endureth even until now, and bringeth forth fruit to our Lord Jesus

Christ, who for our sins suffered even unto death, [but] “whom God raised from the dead,

having loosed the bands of the grave.”^5 “In whom, though now ye see Him not, ye believe,

and believing, rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory;”^6 into which joy many desire

to enter, knowing that “by grace ye are saved, not of works,”^7 but by the will of God through

Jesus Christ.

“Wherefore, girding up your loins,”^8 “serve the Lord in fear”^9 and truth, as those who

have forsaken the vain, empty talk and error of the multitude, and “believed in Him who

raised up our Lord Jesus Christ from the dead, and gave Him glory,”^10 and a throne at His

right hand. To Him all things^11 in heaven and on earth are subject. Him every spirit serves.

He comes as the Judge of the living and the dead.^12 His blood will God require of those who

do not believe in Him.^13 But He who raised Him up from the dead will raise^14 up us also,

if we do His will, and walk in His commandments, and love what He loved, keeping ourselves

from all unrighteousness, covetousness, love of money, evil speaking, false witness; “not

rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing,”^15 or blow for blow, or cursing for cursing, but

being mindful of what the Lord said in His teaching: “Judge not, that ye be not judged;^16

forgive, and it shall be forgiven unto you;^17 be merciful, that ye may obtain mercy;^18 with

what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again;”^19 and once more, “Blessed are

the poor, and those that are persecuted for righteousness’ sake, for theirs is the kingdom of

God.”^20

These things, brethren, I write to you concerning righteousness, not because I take

anything upon myself, but because ye have invited me to do so. For neither I, nor any other

such one, can come up to the wisdom^21 of the blessed and glorified Paul. He, when among

you, accurately and stedfastly taught the word of truth in the presence of those who were

then alive. And when absent from you, he wrote you a letter,^22 which, if you carefully study,

you will find to be the means of building you up in that faith which has been given you, and

which, being followed by hope, and preceded by love towards God, and Christ, and our





34





neighbour, “is the mother of us all.”^23 For if any one be inwardly possessed of these graces,

he hath fulfilled the command of righteousness, since he that hath love is far from all sin.

for a single letter, as we say “by these presents.” But even we might speak of St. Paul as having written his Epistles

to us; so the Epistles to Thessalonica and Corinth might more naturally still be referred to here].

“But the love of money is the root of all evils.”^24 Knowing, therefore, that “as we brought

nothing into the world, so we can carry nothing out,”^25 let us arm ourselves with the armour

of righteousness;^26 and let us teach, first of all, ourselves to walk in the commandments of

the Lord. Next, [teach] your wives [to walk] in the faith given to them, and in love and

purity tenderly loving their own husbands in all truth, and loving all [others] equally in all

chastity; and to train up their children in the knowledge and fear of God. Teach the widows

to be discreet as respects the faith of the Lord, praying continually^27 for all, being far from

all slandering, evil-speaking, false-witnessing, love of money, and every kind of evil; knowing

that they are the altar^28 of God, that He clearly perceives all things, and that nothing is hid

from Him, neither reasonings, nor reflections, nor any one of the secret things of the heart.

Knowing, then, that “God is not mocked,”^29 we ought to walk worthy of His command-

ment and glory. In like manner should the deacons be blameless before the face of His

righteousness, as being the servants of God and Christ,^30 and not of men. They must not

be slanderers, double-tongued,^31 or lovers of money, but temperate in all things, compas-

sionate, industrious, walking according to the truth of the Lord, who was the servant^32 of

all. If we please Him in this present world, we shall receive also the future world, according

as He has promised to us that He will raise us again from the dead, and that if we live^33

worthily of Him, “we shall also reign together with Him,”^34 provided only we believe. In

like manner, let the young men also be blameless in all things, being especially careful to

preserve purity, and keeping themselves in, as with a bridle, from every kind of evil. For it

is well that they should be cut off from^35 the lusts that are in the world, since “every lust

warreth against the spirit;”^36 and “neither fornicators, nor effeminate, nor abusers of

themselves with mankind, shall inherit the kingdom of God,”^37 nor those who do things

inconsistent and unbecoming. Wherefore, it is needful to abstain from all these things, being

subject to the presbyters and deacons, as unto God and Christ. The virgins also must walk

in a blameless and pure conscience.

And let the presbyters be compassionate and merciful to all, bringing back those that

wander, visiting all the sick, and not neglecting the widow, the orphan, or the poor, but always

“providing for that which is becoming in the sight of God and man;”^38 abstaining from all

wrath, respect of persons, and unjust judgment; keeping far off from all covetousness, not

quickly crediting [an evil report] against any one, not severe in judgment, as knowing that

we are all under a debt of sin. If then we entreat the Lord to forgive us, we ought also ourselves

to forgive;^39 for we are before the eyes of our Lord and God, and “we must all appear at the

judgment-seat of Christ, and must every one give an account of himself.”^40 Let us then serve

Him in fear, and with all reverence, even as He Himself has commanded us, and as the

apostles who preached the Gospel unto us, and the prophets who proclaimed beforehand

the coming of the Lord [have alike taught us]. Let us be zealous in the pursuit of that which

is good, keeping ourselves from causes of offence, from false brethren, and from those who

in hypocrisy bear the name of the Lord, and draw away vain men into error.

nor a judgment, he is the first-born of Satan.^43 Wherefore, forsaking the vanity of many,

and their false doctrines, let us return to the word which has been handed down to us from^44

the beginning; “watching unto prayer,”^45 and persevering in fasting; beseeching in our

livers from death.”^57 Be all of you subject one to another^58 “having your conduct blameless

among the Gentiles,”^59 that ye may both receive praise for your good works, and the Lord

may not be blasphemed through you. But woe to him by whom the name of the Lord is

blasphemed!^60 Teach, therefore, sobriety to all, and manifest it also in your own conduct.

I am greatly grieved for Valens, who was once a presbyter among you, because he so

little understands the place that was given him [in the Church]. I exhort you, therefore, that

ye abstain from covetousness,^61 and that ye be chaste and truthful. “Abstain from every

form of evil.”^62 For if a man cannot govern himself in such matters, how shall he enjoin

them on others? If a man does not keep himself from covetousness,^63 he shall be defiled by

idolatry, and shall be judged as one of the heathen. But who of us are ignorant of the judgment

of the Lord? “Do we not know that the saints shall judge the world?”^64 as Paul teaches. But

I have neither seen nor heard of any such thing among you, in the midst of whom the blessed

Paul laboured, and who are commended^65 in the beginning of his Epistle. For he boasts of

you in all those Churches which alone then knew the Lord; but we [of Smyrna] had not yet

known Him. I am deeply grieved, therefore, brethren, for him (Valens) and his wife; to

whom may the Lord grant true repentance! And be ye then moderate in regard to this

matter, and “do not count such as enemies,”^66 but call them back as suffering and straying

members, that ye may save your whole body. For by so acting ye shall edify yourselves.^67





61 Some think that incontinenceon the part of the Valens and his wife is referred to. [For many reasons I am

glad the translators have preferred the reading πλεονεξίας. The next word, chaste, sufficiently rebukes the example

of Valens. For once I venture not to coincide with Jacobson’s comment.]

who remembers^71 this, which I believe to be the case with you. But may the God and Father

of our Lord Jesus Christ, and Jesus Christ Himself, who is the Son of God, and our everlasting

High Priest, build you up in faith and truth, and in all meekness, gentleness, patience, long-

suffering, forbearance, and purity; and may He bestow on you a lot and portion among His

saints, and on us with you, and on all that are under heaven, who shall believe in our Lord

Jesus Christ, and in His Father, who “raised Him from the dead.”^72 Pray for all the saints.

we have by us, we have sent to you, as you requested. They are subjoined to this Epistle, and

by them ye may be greatly profited; for they treat of faith and patience, and all things that

own; hence his restrained and temperate words of interest.]

**### Introductory Note to the Epistle Concerning the Martyrdom of**



**### Polycarp**





Internalevidence goes far to establish the credit which Eusebius lends to this specimen

of the martyrologies, certainly not the earliest if we accept that of Ignatius as genuine. As

an encyclical of one of “the seven churches” to another of the same Seven, and as bearing

witness to their aggregation with others into the unity of “the Holy and Catholic Church,”

it is a very interesting witness, not only to an article of the creed, but to the original meaning

and acceptation of the same. More than this, it is evidence of the strength of Christ perfected

in human weakness; and thus it affords us an assurance of grace equal to our day in every

time of need. When I see in it, however, an example of what a noble army of martyrs, women

and children included, suffered in those days “for the testimony of Jesus,” and in order to

hand down the knowledge of the Gospel to these boastful ages of our own, I confess myself

edified by what I read, chiefly because I am humbled and abashed in comparing what a

Christian used to be, with what a Christian is, in our times, even at his best estate.

That this Epistle has been interpolated can hardly be doubted, when we compare it with

the unvarnished specimen, in Eusebius. As for the “fragrant smell” that came from the fire,

many kinds of wood emit the like in burning; and, apart from Oriental warmth of colouring,

there seems nothing incredible in the narrative if we except “the dove” (chap. xvi.), which,

however, is probably a corrupt reading,^83 as suggested by our translators. The blade was

thrust into the martyr’s left side; and this, opening the heart, caused the outpouring of a

flood, and not a mere trickling. But, though Greek thus amended is a plausible conjecture,

there seems to have been nothing of the kind in the copy quoted by Eusebius. On the other

hand, note the truly catholic and scriptural testimony: “We love the martyrs, but the Son

of God we worship: it is impossible for us to worship any other.”

Bishop Jacobson assigns more than fifty pages to this martyrology, with a Latin version

and abundant notes. To these I must refer the student, who may wish to see this attractive

history in all the light of critical scholarship and, often, of admirable comment.

The following is the original Introductory Notice:—

The following letter purports to have been written by the Church at Smyrna to the

Church at Philomelium, and through that Church to the whole Christian world, in order

to give a succinct account of the circumstances attending the martyrdom of Polycarp. It is

the earliest of all the Martyria, and has generally been accounted both the most interesting

and authentic. Not a few, however, deem it interpolated in several passages, and some refer

it to a much later date than the middle of the second century, to which it has been commonly

ascribed. We cannot tell how much it may owe to the writers (chap. xxii.) who successively

transcribed it. Great part of it has been engrossed by Eusebius in his Ecclesiastical History

(iv. 15); and it is instructive to observe, that some of the most startling miraculous phenomena

recorded in the text as it now stands, have no place in the narrative as given by that early

historian of the Church. Much discussion has arisen respecting several particulars contained

in this Martyrium; but into these disputes we do not enter, having it for our aim simply to

present the reader with as faithful a translation as possible of this very interesting monument

of Christian antiquity.

We have written to you, brethren, as to what relates to the martyrs, and especially to

the blessed Polycarp, who put an end to the persecution, having, as it were, set a seal upon

it by his martyrdom. For almost all the events that happened previously [to this one], took

place that the Lord might show us from above a martyrdom becoming the Gospel. For he

waited to be delivered up, even as the Lord had done, that we also might become his followers,

while we look not merely at what concerns ourselves but have regard also to our neighbours.

For it is the part of a true and well-founded love, not only to wish one’s self to be saved, but

also all the brethren.

will of God. For it becomes us who profess^86 greater piety than others, to ascribe the authority

over all things to God. And truly,^87 who can fail to admire their nobleness of mind, and

their patience, with that love towards their Lord which they displayed?—who, when they

were so torn with scourges, that the frame of their bodies, even to the very inward veins and

arteries, was laid open, still patiently endured, while even those that stood by pitied and

bewailed them. But they reached such a pitch of magnanimity, that not one of them let a

sigh or a groan escape them; thus proving to us all that those holy martyrs of Christ, at the

very time when they suffered such torments, were absent from the body, or rather, that the

Lord then stood by them, and communed with them. And, looking to the grace of Christ,

they despised all the torments of this world, redeeming themselves from eternal punishment

by [the suffering of] a single hour. For this reason the fire of their savage executioners ap-

peared cool to them. For they kept before their view escape from that fire which is eternal

and never shall be quenched, and looked forward with the eyes of their heart to those good

things which are laid up for such as endure; things “which ear hath not heard, nor eye seen,

neither have entered into the heart of man,”^88 but were revealed by the Lord to them, inas-

much as they were no longer men, but had already become angels. And, in like manner,

those who were condemned to the wild beasts endured dreadful tortures, being stretched

out upon beds full of spikes, and subjected to various other kinds of torments, in order that,

if it were possible, the tyrant might, by their lingering tortures, lead them to a denial [of

Christ].





86 Literally, “who are more pious.”

**#### Chapter III.—The constancy of Germanicus. The death of Polycarp is demanded.**





For the devil did indeed invent many things against them; but thanks be to God, he

could not prevail over all. For the most noble Germanicus strengthened the timidity of

others by his own patience, and fought heroically^89 with the wild beasts. For, when the





40





proconsul sought to persuade him, and urged him^90 to take pity upon his age, he attracted

the wild beast towards himself, and provoked it, being desirous to escape all the more quickly

from an unrighteous and impious world. But upon this the whole multitude, marvelling at

the nobility of mind displayed by the devout and godly race of Christians,^91 cried out, “Away

with the Atheists; let Polycarp be sought out!”





89 Or, “illustriously.”

90 Or, “said to him.”

Now one named Quintus, a Phrygian, who was but lately come from Phrygia, when he

saw the wild beasts, became afraid. This was the man who forced himself and some others

to come forward voluntarily [for trial]. Him the proconsul, after many entreaties, persuaded

to swear and to offer sacrifice. Wherefore, brethren, we do not commend those who give

themselves up [to suffering], seeing the Gospel does not teach so to do.^92

**#### Chapter V.—The departure and vision of Polycarp.**





But the most admirable Polycarp, when he first heard [that he was sought for], was in

no measure disturbed, but resolved to continue in the city. However, in deference to the

wish of many, he was persuaded to leave it. He departed, therefore, to a country house not

far distant from the city. There he stayed with a few [friends], engaged in nothing else night

and day than praying for all men, and for the Churches throughout the world, according

to his usual custom. And while he was praying, a vision presented itself to him three days

before he was taken; and, behold, the pillow under his head seemed to him on fire. Upon

this, turning to those that were with him, he said to them prophetically, “I must be burnt

alive.”

**#### Chapter VI.—Polycarp is betrayed by a servant.**





And when those who sought for him were at hand, he departed to another dwelling,

whither his pursuers immediately came after him. And when they found him not, they seized

upon two youths [that were there], one of whom, being subjected to torture, confessed. It

was thus impossible that he should continue hid, since those that betrayed him were of his

own household. The Irenarch^93 then (whose office is the same as that of the Cleronomus^94 ),

by name Herod, hastened to bring him into the stadium. [This all happened] that he might

fulfil his special lot, being made a partaker of Christ, and that they who betrayed him might

undergo the punishment of Judas himself.





93 It was the duty of the Irenarch to apprehend all seditious troublers of the public peace.

94 Some think that those magistrates bore this name that were elected by lot.

**#### Chapter VII.—Polycarp is found by his pursuers.**





His pursuers then, along with horsemen, and taking the youth with them, went forth

at supper-time on the day of the preparation^95 with their usual weapons, as if going out

against a robber.^96 And being come about evening [to the place where he was], they found

him lying down in the upper room of^97 a certain little house, from which he might have

escaped into another place; but he refused, saying, “The will of God^98 be done.”^99 So when

he heard that they were come, he went down and spake with them. And as those that were

present marvelled at his age and constancy, some of them said. “Was so much effort^100

made to capture such a venerable man?”^101 Immediately then, in that very hour, he ordered

that something to eat and drink should be set before them, as much indeed as they cared

for, while he besought them to allow him an hour to pray without disturbance. And on their

giving him leave, he stood and prayed, being full of the grace of God, so that he could not

cease^102 for two full hours, to the astonishment of them that heard him, insomuch that

many began to repent that they had come forth against so godly and venerable an old man.

**#### Chapter VIII.—Polycarp is brought into the city.**





Now, as soon as he had ceased praying, having made mention of all that had at any time

come in contact with him, both small and great, illustrious and obscure, as well as the whole

Catholic Church throughout the world, the time of his departure having arrived, they set

him upon an ass, and conducted him into the city, the day being that of the great Sabbath.

And the Irenarch Herod, accompanied by his father Nicetes (both riding in a chariot^103 ),

met him, and taking him up into the chariot, they seated themselves beside him, and endeav-

oured to persuade him, saying, “What harm is there in saying, Lord Cæsar,^104 and in sacri-

ficing, with the other ceremonies observed on such occasions, and so make sure of safety?”





41





But he at first gave them no answer; and when they continued to urge him, he said, “I shall

not do as you advise me.” So they, having no hope of persuading him, began to speak bitter^105

words unto him, and cast him with violence out of the chariot,^106 insomuch that, in getting

down from the carriage, he dislocated his leg^107 [by the fall]. But without being disturbed,^108

and as if suffering nothing, he went eagerly forward with all haste, and was conducted to

the stadium, where the tumult was so great, that there was no possibility of being heard.





103 Jacobson deems these words an interpolation.

104 Or, “Cæsar is Lord,” all the mss. having κύριοςinstead of κύριε, as usually printed.

105 Or, “terrible.”

106 Or, “cast him down” simply, the following words being, as above, an interpolation.

107 Or, “sprained his ankle.”

108 Or, “not turning back.”

**#### Chapter IX.—Polycarp refuses to revile Christ.**





Now, as Polycarp was entering into the stadium, there came to him a voice from heaven,

saying, “Be strong, and show thyself a man, O Polycarp!” No one saw who it was that spoke

to him; but those of our brethren who were present heard the voice. And as he was brought

forward, the tumult became great when they heard that Polycarp was taken. And when he

came near, the proconsul asked him whether he was Polycarp. On his confessing that he

was, [the proconsul] sought to persuade him to deny [Christ], saying, “Have respect to thy

old age,” and other similar things, according to their custom, [such as], “Swear by the fortune

of Cæsar; repent, and say, Away with the Atheists.” But Polycarp, gazing with a stern

countenance on all the multitude of the wicked heathen then in the stadium, and waving

his hand towards them, while with groans he looked up to heaven, said, “Away with the

Atheists.”^109 Then, the proconsul urging him, and saying, “Swear, and I will set thee at

liberty, reproach Christ;” Polycarp declared, “Eighty and six years have I served Him, and

He never did me any injury: how then can I blaspheme my King and my Saviour?”





109 Referring the words to the heathen, and not to the Christians, as was desired.

And when the proconsul yet again pressed him, and said, “Swear by the fortune of

Cæsar,” he answered, “Since thou art vainly urgent that, as thou sayest, I should swear by

the fortune of Cæsar, and pretendest not to know who and what I am, hear me declare with

boldness, I am a Christian. And if you wish to learn what the doctrines^110 of Christianity

are, appoint me a day, and thou shalt hear them.” The proconsul replied, “Persuade the

people.” But Polycarp said, “To thee I have thought it right to offer an account [of my faith];

for we are taught to give all due honour (which entails no injury upon ourselves) to the

powers and authorities which are ordained of God.^111 But as for these, I do not deem them

worthy of receiving any account from me.”^112

**#### Chapter XI.—No threats have any effect on Polycarp.**





The proconsul then said to him, “I have wild beasts at hand; to these will I cast thee,

except thou repent.” But he answered, “Call them then, for we are not accustomed to repent

of what is good in order to adopt that which is evil;^113 and it is well for me to be changed

from what is evil to what is righteous.”^114 But again the proconsul said to him, “I will cause

thee to be consumed by fire, seeing thou despisest the wild beasts, if thou wilt not repent.”

But Polycarp said, “Thou threatenest me with fire which burneth for an hour, and after a

little is extinguished, but art ignorant of the fire of the coming judgment and of eternal

punishment, reserved for the ungodly. But why tarriest thou? Bring forth what thou wilt.”





113 Literally, “repentance from things better to things worse is a change impossible to us.”

114 That is, to leave this world for a better.

**#### Chapter XII.—Polycarp is sentenced to be burned.**





While he spoke these and many other like things, he was filled with confidence and joy,

and his countenance was full of grace, so that not merely did it not fall as if troubled by the

things said to him, but, on the contrary, the proconsul was astonished, and sent his herald

to proclaim in the midst of the stadium thrice, “Polycarp has confessed that he is a Christian.”

This proclamation having been made by the herald, the whole multitude both of the heathen

and Jews, who dwelt at Smyrna, cried out with uncontrollable fury, and in a loud voice,

“This is the teacher of Asia,^115 the father of the Christians, and the overthrower of our gods,

he who has been teaching many not to sacrifice, or to worship the gods.” Speaking thus,

they cried out, and besought Philip the Asiarch^116 to let loose a lion upon Polycarp. But

Philip answered that it was not lawful for him to do so, seeing the shows^117 of wild beasts

were already finished. Then it seemed good to them to cry out with one consent, that Polycarp

should be burnt alive. For thus it behooved the vision which was revealed to him in regard

to his pillow to be fulfilled, when, seeing it on fire as he was praying, he turned about and

said prophetically to the faithful that were with him, “I must be burnt alive.”





115 Some read, “ungodliness,” but the above seems preferable.

116 The Asiarchs were those who superintended all arrangements connected with the games in the several

provinces.

117 Literally, “the baiting of dogs.”

**#### Chapter XIII.—The funeral pile is erected.**





This, then, was carried into effect with greater speed than it was spoken, the multitudes

immediately gathering together wood and fagots out of the shops and baths; the Jews espe-

cially, according to custom, eagerly assisting them in it. And when the funeral pile was ready,

Polycarp, laying aside all his garments, and loosing his girdle, sought also to take off his

sandals,—a thing he was not accustomed to do, inasmuch as every one of the faithful was

always eager who should first touch his skin. For, on account of his holy life,^118 he was, even

before his martyrdom, adorned^119 with every kind of good. Immediately then they surroun-

ded him with those substances which had been prepared for the funeral pile. But when they

were about also to fix him with nails, he said, “Leave me as I am; for He that giveth me

strength to endure the fire, will also enable me, without your securing me by nails, to remain

without moving in the pile.”





118 Literally, “good behaviour.”

119 Some think this implies that Polycarp’s skin was believed to possess a miraculous efficacy.

They did not nail him then, but simply bound him. And he, placing his hands behind

him, and being bound like a distinguished ram [taken] out of a great flock for sacrifice, and

prepared to be an acceptable burnt-offering unto God, looked up to heaven, and said, “O

Lord God Almighty, the Father of thy beloved and blessed Son Jesus Christ, by whom we

have received the knowledge of Thee, the God of angels and powers, and of every creature,

and of the whole race of the righteous who live before thee, I give Thee thanks that Thou

hast counted me worthy of this day and this hour, that I should have a part in the number

of Thy martyrs, in the cup^120 of thy Christ, to the resurrection of eternal life, both of soul

and body, through the incorruption [imparted] by the Holy Ghost. Among whom may I be

accepted this day before Thee as a fat^121 and acceptable sacrifice, according as Thou, the

ever-truthful^122 God, hast foreordained, hast revealed beforehand to me, and now hast ful-

filled. Wherefore also I praise Thee for all things, I bless Thee, I glorify Thee, along with the

everlasting and heavenly Jesus Christ, Thy beloved Son, with whom, to Thee, and the Holy

Ghost, be glory both now and to all coming ages. Amen.”^123

122 Literally, “the not false and true God.”

123 Eusebius (Hist. Eccl., iv. 15) has preserved a great portion of this Martyrium, but in a text considerably

differing from that we have followed. Here, instead of “and,” he has “in the Holy Ghost.”

When he had pronounced this amen, and so finished his prayer, those who were appoin-

whom it was given to witness it, beheld a great miracle, and have been preserved that we

might report to others what then took place. For the fire, shaping itself into the form of an

arch, like the sail of a ship when filled with the wind, encompassed as by a circle the body

of the martyr. And he appeared within not like flesh which is burnt, but as bread that is

baked, or as gold and silver glowing in a furnace. Moreover, we perceived such a sweet odour

[coming from the pile], as if frankincense or some such precious spices had been smoking^125

there.

At length, when those wicked men perceived that his body could not be consumed by

the fire, they commanded an executioner to go near and pierce him through with a dagger.

And on his doing this, there came forth a dove,^126 and a great quantity of blood, so that the

fire was extinguished; and all the people wondered that there should be such a difference

between the unbelievers and the elect, of whom this most admirable Polycarp was one,

having in our own times been an apostolic and prophetic teacher, and bishop of the Catholic

Church which is in Smyrna. For every word that went out of his mouth either has been or

shall yet be accomplished.





126 Eusebius omits all mention of the dove, and many have thought the text to be here corrupt. It has been

proposed to read ἐπ’ ἀριστερᾷ, “on the left hand side,” instead of περιστερά, “a dove.”

But when the adversary of the race of the righteous, the envious, malicious, and wicked

one, perceived the impressive^127 nature of his martyrdom, and [considered] the blameless

life he had led from the beginning, and how he was now crowned with the wreath of immor-

tality, having beyond dispute received his reward, he did his utmost that not the least me-

morial of him should be taken away by us, although many desired to do this, and to become

possessors^128 of his holy flesh. For this end he suggested it to Nicetes, the father of Herod

and brother of Alce, to go and entreat the governor not to give up his body to be buried,





43





“lest,” said he, “forsaking Him that was crucified, they begin to worship this one.” This he

said at the suggestion and urgent persuasion of the Jews, who also watched us, as we sought

to take him out of the fire, being ignorant of this, that it is neither possible for us ever to

forsake Christ, who suffered for the salvation of such as shall be saved throughout the whole

world (the blameless one for sinners^129 ), nor to worship any other. For Him indeed, as being

the Son of God, we adore; but the martyrs, as disciples and followers of the Lord, we worthily

love on account of their extraordinary^130 affection towards their own King and Master, of

whom may we also be made companions^131 and fellow-disciples!





127 Literally, “greatness.”

128 The Greek, literally translated, is, “and to have fellowship with his holy flesh.”

129 This clause is omitted by Eusebius: it was probably interpolated by some transcriber, who had in his mind

in a fitting place, whither, being gathered together, as opportunity is allowed us, with joy

and rejoicing, the Lord shall grant us to celebrate the anniversary^134 of his martyrdom, both

in memory of those who have already finished their course,^135 and for the exercising and

This, then, is the account of the blessed Polycarp, who, being the twelfth that was mar-

in the memory of all men, insomuch that he is everywhere spoken of by the heathen them-

selves. He was not merely an illustrious teacher, but also a pre-eminent martyr, whose

martyrdom all desire to imitate, as having been altogether consistent with the Gospel of

Christ. For, having through patience overcome the unjust governor, and thus acquired the

crown of immortality, he now, with the apostles and all the righteous [in heaven], rejoicingly

glorifies God, even the Father, and blesses our Lord Jesus Christ, the Saviour of our souls,

the Governor of our bodies, and the Shepherd of the Catholic Church throughout the

world.^137





136 Literally, “is alone remembered.”

Now, the blessed Polycarp suffered martyrdom on the second day of the month

Xanthicus just begun,^140 the seventh day before the Kalends of May, on the great Sabbath,

at the eighth hour.^141 He was taken by Herod, Philip the Trallian being high priest,^142 Sta-

tius Quadratus being proconsul, but Jesus Christ being King for ever, to whom be glory,

honour, majesty, and an everlasting throne, from generation to generation. Amen.





140 The translation is here very doubtful. Wake renders the words μηνὸς ἱσταμένου, “of the presentmonth.”

141 Great obscurity hangs over the chronology here indicated. According to Usher, the Smyrnæans began

the month Xanthicus on the 25th of March. But the seventh day before the Kalends of May is the 25th of April.

Some, therefore, read ̓Απριλλίωνinstead of Μαίων. The great Sabbath is that before the passover. The “eighth

hour” may correspond either to our 8 a.m. or 2 p.m.

salvation of His holy elect, after whose example^143 the blessed Polycarp suffered, following

in whose steps may we too be found in the kingdom of Jesus Christ!

These things^144 Caius transcribed from the copy of Irenæus (who was a disciple of

Polycarp), having himself been intimate with Irenæus. And I Socrates transcribed them at

Corinth from the copy of Caius. Grace be with you all.

And I again, Pionius, wrote them from the previously written copy, having carefully





44





searched into them, and the blessed Polycarp having manifested them to me through a

revelation, even as I shall show in what follows. I have collected these things, when they had

almost faded away through the lapse of time, that the Lord Jesus Christ may also gather me

along with His elect into His heavenly kingdom, to whom, with the Father and the Holy

Spirit, be glory for ever and ever. Amen.





143 Literally, “according as.”
